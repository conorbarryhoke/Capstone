(Joe Williams)

Recorded: Aurora, May 5, 1937
Big Joe Williams (g) (vcl)
Robert Lee McCoy (g), John Lee „Sonnyboy Williamson (h)

Born in Crawford, Mississippi, Williams as a youth began wandering across the United States busking and playing stores, bars, alleys and work camps. In the early 1920s he worked in the Rabbit Foot Minstrels revue and recorded with the Birmingham Jug Band in 1930 for the Okeh label.

In 1934 he was in St. Louis, where he met record producer Lester Melrose who signed him to a contract with Bluebird Records in 1935. He stayed with Bluebird for ten years, recording such blues hits as ""Baby, Please Don't Go"" (1935) and ""Crawlin' King Snake"" (1941), both songs later covered by many other performers. He also recorded with other blues singers, including John Lee ""Sonny Boy"" Williamson, Robert Nighthawk and Peetie Wheatstraw.

Williams remained a noted blues artist in the 1950s and 1960s, with his guitar style and vocals becoming popular with folk-blues fans. He recorded for the Trumpet, Delmark, Prestige and Vocalion labels, among others. He became a regular on the concert and coffeehouse circuits, touring Europe and Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and performing at major U.S. Festivals.

Big Joe's guitar playing is decidedly in the Delta Blues style, and yet is unique. He played driving rhythm and virtuosic lead lines simultaneously and sang over it all. He played with picks both on his thumb and index finger, plus his guitar was very heavily modified. Williams added a rudimentary electric pick-up, whose wires coiled all over the top of his guitar. He also added three extra strings, creating unison pairs for the first, second and fourth strings. His guitar was usually tuned to Open G, like such: (D2 G2 D3D3 G3 B3B3 D4D4), with a capo placed on the second fret to set the tuning to the key of A. During the 1920s and 1930s, Big Joe had gradually added these extra strings in order to keep other guitar players from being able to play his guitar. In his later years, he would also occasionally use a 12-string guitar with all strings tuned in unison to Open G. It is little known that Big Joe sometimes tuned a six-string guitar to an interesting modification of Open G. In this modified tuning, the bass D string (D2) was replaced with a .08 gauge string and tuned to G4. The resulting tuning was (G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4), with the G4 string being used as a melody string by Big Joe. This tuning was used exclusively for slide playing. He was inducted into the W. C. Handy Blues Hall of Fame on October 4, 1992.

He died December 17, 1982 in Macon, Mississippi. Big Joe is buried in private cemetery outside Crawford near the Lowndes County line. His headstone was primarilly paid for by friends and partially funded by a collection taken up among musicians at Clifford Antone's night club in Austin, Texas, organized by California music writer Dan Forte, and erected through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund on October 9, 1994. Harmonica virtuoso and one time touring companion of Williams Charlie Musselwhite delivered the eulogy at the unveiling. Williams' headstone epitaph, composed by Dan Forte, proclaims him ""King of the 9 String Guitar"".",1,162,0,0,45,2009-01-03 17:29:15,0,"Blues, Roots_of_Blues, History_of_music, Vintage_Blues",Roots of Blues  Big Joe Williams „I Wont Be In Hard Luck No More,qCholznAGfA,8344,CKwCEAA,a,0,9,1,3,3,5,3.921374295418474,0.6020599913279624,1.6532125137753435,0.0,3,1,0.03517006802721088,546,0.0,3,-0.1805555555555556,14,0,2,0,1,1,4,1,1,0,3,0,1,3,1,2,7,0,0,2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,64,0.42159008276941823,0.1535329060608617,10.0,1,0,0.0

We would like to take a moment to celebrate 10 years of LOPAZZ on Get Physical! From iconic releases like 'Migracion' to his latest effort 'U & I' together with Betoko, and all the amazing mastering in between, LOPAZZ has taken us for a beautiful ride. 

Now we revisit one of those old favorites, 'Share My Rhythm' re-edited for 2013 and doubled up with a Daniel Bortz Remix.

The '2013 Edit' brings the full vibe of the original, varying only slightly in composition. Produced entirely on analogue machines, using zero computer support, LOPAZZ and his „Bad Cop Bad Cop"" partner in crime, Alex Cortex, manage to pump out the perfect After-Hour or warm up track. 

The Daniel Bortz remix is another deep-house tune with that signature Bortz spirit, stripped down to the maximum deepness... It set's a dark mood across the floor while providing enough energy to push you deep into the night.

This is the sonata for solo piano by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt (1811-1886). He composed it between 1852 and 1853 while traveling across Europe as a performing virtuoso, publishing it one year later with a dedication to Robert Schumann in return for dedicating his 1836 Fantasie in C, Op. 17 , to Liszt. Although the sonata is played as one continuous movement, it has three distinct sections: following a solemn invocation based of one of the principle themes, there is a stormy opening section marked Allegro energico, which introduces four other main motifs; next, there is a slow, meditative though emotionally fraught Recitativo section corresponding roughly to the development; then, the brisk Allegro energico tempo is resumed in a grand fugato that weaves together a few of the principle motifs, leading into a recapitulation of the first section and a more tranquil final coda.

HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
Youre the light in my deepest darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

Daniel McCarthy (b.1955) is currently Chair of Composition and Theory at the University of Akron School of Music.  His works for percussion, marimba, chamber ensemble, and symphonic band have been praised by critics worldwide, earning him multiple nominations for the Pulitzer Prize and Grawemeyer Awards.  During the summer, Dr. McCarthy teaches composition at the Interlochen Center for the Arts.   

The Call of Boromir (1997) depicts the fall of Boromir, Son of Denothor, from J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings.  Boromir was known for a horn he carried in his belt.  In times of need, he would blow his horn which could be heard from many miles away.  His horn call struck fear in the enemy and drew those with good hearts to his defense.  As members of the Fellowship heard Boromirs horn, they rushed to his side only to find him dying, pierced by arrows and laying at the bottom of a tree.

With the interval of a 3rd, I guess. It permeates the work at every level, creating close coordination between motivic/harmonic detail, and tonal structure. The main theme of each movement is built from the same motif: a rising and then falling 3rd. In the final movement the 3rd both defies the movement in the bass in the introduction, as well as the shape of the fugue theme: a rising 3rd (10th), following by a scalar figure that is repeated, each time descending by a 3rd. Harmonically, the development section of the third movement is built on a sequence of 3rds, and the trio of the scherzo oscillates between Bb Minor and Db Major, two keys separated by a 3rd.

At an even deeper structural level, the 3rd is all-pervasive. You’d expect, in a Bb Maj sonata, that the dominant key of F would play a major role, but in 40+ minutes of music there is not a single modulation to that key. Instead, Beethoven constructs an intricate system of four keys around Bb, and returns to them time and time again. Three of them, G, D, and F#, are all separated from Bb by the interval of a third. The final, the “black key” of B Minor, occurs in every movement and functions as an anti-thesis to Bb Major. The struggle between these two keys dramatically frames the entire sonata (just listen to the scherzo’s ending).

There’s lots more to the Hammerklavier than the 3rd. You’ve got structural innovations: in the 1st movement’s recapitulation the return to the stable tonic is heavily delayed (by, yes, the key of B minor), and in the 2nd the development is too short, but the recapitulation varies and decorates the theme so extensively that it becomes a sort of extended development. And you’ve got the sheer contrapuntal and dramatic genius of the last movement, where a huge number of traditional contrapuntal devices are wielded with a jaggedness and fury that belies their conservative associations. It's also worth noting how contrapuntal the writing in the 1st movement is -- one of the most striking features of Beethoven's late work.

MVT 4:
PART I
29:52 – Introduction. Note movement by 3rds in bass, interspersed with episodes of original material.
PART II
32:37 – Introduction and development of fugue theme [Theme 1] and countersubject. Note how long the theme is, containing a leap and trill in the head (ordinarily a concluding device), scalar descent in 3rds in the middle, and a long chromatic tail with much implied dissonance.
PART III
34:07 – Introduction and brief development of new theme [Theme 2] in Gb Maj
34:21 – Augmentation [doubled note value] of fugue theme, with countersubject (note the constant descent by 3rds)
34:49 – Stretto [overlapping entry] of the fugue theme’s head [leap + trill]
PART IV
34:57 – Return to Theme 2, in Ab Maj
35:34 – Theme 1 in retrograde [backwards]
36:10 – Stretti of Theme 1, initially in inversion, then including original (Note key of B)
36:46 – Entire subject in mirrored form
37:20 – Increasing focus on Theme 1’s head, leading to trill-laden passage at 37:30
PART V
37:41 – Chorale (Theme 3)
PART VI
38:23 – Theme 3 functions as cantus firmus, and is combined with the first half of Theme 1
38:44 – Stretto of Theme 1 (inversion + original). The music appears to be reaching a conclusion, as we’re in the right key, the dominant is playing a bigger role (from 39:12 it recurs as a pedal point in the bass), and stretti/pedal points seem to militate for a conclusion.
39:32 – But nope. Just as we reach the point where the concluding bars should be, Beethoven begins the fugue anew.
39:47 – Exploration of subject, countersubject, and their inversions (in stretto)
40:13 – Abruptly, the music cadences, and on the wrong [weak] beat too.
PART VII
40:15 – The fugue subject briefly enters, before a trill begins in the bass at 40:18 
40:26 – As the trill continues, the RH toys with the fugue subject and countersubject. Eventually a F pedal emerges.
40:38 – Theme 1’s head is repeated, then its middle.

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,223,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was described by Mozart himself in his own thematic catalogue as ""for beginners,"" and it is sometimes known by the nickname Sonata facile or Sonata semplice. Mozart added the work to his catalogue on June 26, 1788, the same date as his Symphony No. 39. The exact circumstances of the work's composition are not known, however. Although the piece is well-known today, it was not published in Mozart's lifetime and first appeared in print in 1805. A typical performance takes about 14 minutes. The work has three movements:
1. Allegro
2. Andante
3. Rondo
The first movement is written in sonata form and is in the key of C major. The familiar opening theme is accompanied by an Alberti bass, played in the left hand.
A bridge passage composed of scales follows, arriving at a cadence in G major, the key in which the second theme is then played. A codetta follows to conclude the exposition, then the exposition is repeated. The development starts in G minor and modulates through several keys. The recapitulation begins, unusually, in the subdominant key of F major. According to Charles Rosen, the practice of beginning a recapitulation in the subdominant was ""rare at the time [the sonata] was written,"" though the practice was later taken up by Franz Schubert. The second movement is in the key of G major, the dominant key of C major. The music modulates in the middle of this movement to the parallel minor (G minor) and its relative major (B-flat major). The movement then modulates to the tonic, and, after the main theme and development is heard again, ends.
The third movement is in rondo form and is in the tonic key, C major. The first theme is lively and sets the mood of the piece. The second theme is in G major and contains an Alberti bass in the left hand. The first theme appears again and is followed by a third theme. The third theme is in a minor key and modulates through many different keys before modulating into C major. The first theme appears again followed by a coda and finally ends in C major.
The finale was transcribed to F major and collected with a solo piano arrangement of the second movement of the violin sonata in F major to form the Piano Sonata in F major, K. 547a.

A. Our CDs are available on iTunes, Google, Amazon, CD Baby and just about everywhere; you can also buy a CD in a jewel case from Kunaki: https://www.voicesofmusic.org/cds.html
Q.  What is Early Music performance, or historical performance?
A. We play on instruments from the time of the composers, and we use the original music and playing techniques: it’s a special sound.
Q.  Why are there no conductors?
A. Conductors weren’t invented until the 19th century; since we seek to recreate a historical performance, the music is led from the keyboard or violin, or the music is played as chamber music~or both :)
Q.  What are period instruments or original instruments; how are they different from modern instruments?
A. As instruments became modernized in the 19th century, builders and players tended to focus on the volume of sound and the stability of tuning. Modern steel strings replaced the older materials, and instruments were often machine made. Historical instruments, built individually by hand and with overall lighter construction, have extremely complex overtones—which we find delightful. Modern instruments are of course perfectly suited to more modern music.
Q. Why is the pitch lower, or higher?
A. Early Music performance uses many different pitches, and these pitches create different tone colors on the instruments. See https://goo.gl/pVBNAC
Bach's prelude BWV 999 features a dialogue of two textures. The more present texture, which consists of an endless arpeggio in the treble range, is accompanied by a flat-footed bass line that is almost invariably composed of two melodic skips downwards. This bass pattern is varied only once, in the thirty-third bar  (Bach loved to construct pattern in threes), where the work stabilizes in G Major before the final coda. In the arpeggiated part, long lines of counterpoint are carefully woven into the chordal texture, also resolving in the thirty-third bar with the bass line. In the middle section of the work, the stepwise motion of the bass settles on a long pedal point on D which oscillates briefly with the E Flat a half step higher; the E Flat is the pivot point between the two keys of C Minor and G Major.

To use Richard Crocker's term, the arpeggios ""ruffle"" the homophony, and Bach uses his genius to create a small gem of a prelude from the different textures and harmonies.

The original manuscript for the prelude includes the rubric ""pour le luth"" (for the lute), and the work can be performed on different types of lutes or keyboards including the lute harpsichord, and sounds well on all of these. On the lute, the performer can use dynamics to accentuate some of the contrapuntal lines, but the work is equally persuasive on the keyboard.
Pitch A=415; temperament: Neidhardt-Doodle

Out of tune and out of time

Do you give
Do you live from day to day
Is there is no song I can play for you

Before someone gets on my case about it: I'm aware that I'm not playing the song in the key of C (I believe it's in D here). If that bothers you, I apologize. I change the key of songs a lot if I think it would better fit my voice or the way I want to play on the guitar. I wouldn't even mention it if the key wasn't in the title of the song. (Honestly, I find the situation kind of funny. That is probably just me, though.)

Now on the song itself: This is not the average Elliott tune. It is purer folk and, quite frankly, it's is more upbeat. The subject is also ultimately happy, though the words do have the average dark undertone to them.

Punnany Massif - Élvezd (Sun Kick EP 2011)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bánatos balladáktól tajtékzik a tenger,
Szomorú éjszakák után örömteli a reggel.
Szemhéj csukódik, pupilla tág,
Fel a fejjel Magyarország: Guten Tag!
Élvezd, amíg van még mit, mintha ez a perc lenne az utolsó,
Nem attól haladsz előre, ha össze-vissza futkosol.
Palota vagy piszkos ól,
Az biztos: minden úr szereti a nőket,
Hát szeress te is Biztos Úr!
Tiszta sor: Az élet téged igazol,
Senki nem bánt, ha járod utad öröm-ittasul.
Élvezd, hogyha rád tör a lámpaláz,
Semmi sem bonyolult annyira, hogy ráparázz.
Nyáron-télen a népem szolgálom és védem,
Neked én vagyok, nekem te vagy a testvérem.
Élvezd, még ha fáj is minden egyes frázis,
A külvilág csak színfalak, szívedben a bázis.

Refr.: (2X)
Nem kérlek légy enyém örökké, mégis hozzád szól dalom,
Úgysem élhetünk örökké, egy percig lennék oltalom.

Élvezd...
Ha nekem jó, jó neked...
Ha üres a fejed lesz mivel megtöltened.
Élvezd...
Ha nap süti szemedet,
Mindegy a szereped,
A lényeg a szeretet.
Élvezd...
Hogy minden rosszban van valami,
Ha egymagad maradsz is lehetsz még valaki.
Élvezd...
Ha újnak látszik, ami maradi,
De ne gondolkodd túl a dolgokat, mert maradsz wanna be.

Élvezd...
Hisz ugyanúgy mindenki téveszt,
Tapasztalatod majd később pont ezért lesz,
Ne vedd magad komolyan, okosítás hiába van,
Az én világomban vakot vezet a világtalan.
Élvezd...
Hogyha rontottál tanulhatsz belőle,
Ilyenkor nincs más hátra, mint előre.
A rosszat jó követ, nem lesz folyton nehézség,
Nem baj, ha nem sportolsz, lehet fél egészség,
Élvezd az életnek minden egyes percét,
Megérdemled az időt, hogy tartalmasan teljék.
Élvezd a napsütést, hogy éppen nem esik,
Élvezd a munkát, hisz tudod, hogy az nemesít,
Élvezd, hogy valamihez tisztán jutsz hozzá,
Így nem kell aggódnod, hogy jön a jakobinus-puttonyszáj.
Ha beborul az ég, és jön a jégeső,
Mosolyogva dobjál be te is velünk egy jäger-sört.

Refr.: (2X + még 2X)

Élvezd, hogy látsz, szagolsz, érzel, kelsz, fekszel,
Hogy a szeretted rád mosolyog ezerszer,
Élvezd az illatot, ez a szabadság,
Tárd ki a szárnyad, repülj el rab madár.

Septett Militaire for piano, flute, violin, clarinet, cello, trumpet & double bass (or for piano quintet) in C major, Op. 114, written in 1829.

19:22 - III. Menuetto. Allegro 
24:28 - IV. Finale. Vivace 

Hummel's so-called ‘Military’ Septet, dating from October 1829, is scored for piano, flute, clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello and double bass, with a quintet arrangement along the same lines as the 1st Piano Septet Op. 74 [uploaded on this channel]. Such was Hummel’s enormous popularity at this time that the work was published virtually simultaneously in London, Paris and Vienna in 1830. Military first movements were all the rage in Vienna at the turn of the nineteenth century, the most celebrated example prior to Hummel’s Septet being Woffl’s Grand Concert Militaire. As befits a piece of this description, the trumpet is called upon in the fast movements to colour the music militaristically, its only real justification for this debut in the chamber music of the Classical period. Its use here can hardly be said to have caught on in a big way, but Hummel's piece undoubtedly inspired Saint-Saëns to use the instrument in his Septet, Op. 65. 

- The ebullient Allegro con brio first movement immediately establishes the greater sense of equality between the various instrumental lines. After a piano-dominated opening, all the treble instruments have a go – trumpet, violin, then clarinet – and it is the clarinet which eventually introduces the wistful G major second subject.
- The serenely drawn lines of the Adagio naturally dispense with the services of the trumpet, but... 
- the dramatic Beethovenian Menuetto (another scherzo), features the inevitable clarion calls in its gentle middle section, humorously recalled at the very end. 
- The various musical elements which combine to make up the Vivace finale, place the piece firmly in its historical context. For whilst there is an undeniable whiff of early Beethoven apparent in the melodic writing (and the throwaway fugato passage near the beginning), the fizzing arpeggiac figurations in the piano part clearly point the way forward to Mendelssohn. At the end, the music dies away enchantingly, in total contradiction to one's natural expectations.",3,1807,0,0,94,2015-10-10 20:07:21,0,,"Johann Nepomuk Hummel - Piano Septet No. 2 in C Major, Op. 114, ""Military""",UFs7Oq_iqU8,10381,CMIDEAA,c,0,15,10,10,283,5,4.016239191042638,1.0,1.9731278535996983,0.4771212547196624,4,41,0.06212121212121211,384,0.0,0,-0.018750000000000003,13,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,4,1,1,2,3,4,5,3,0,2,0,3,2,0,0,0,1,0,74,0.4912874357683521,0.24898915438858465,4.135485128951194,1,0,0.0

Q. Where can I buy CDs?
A. Our CDs are available on iTunes, Google, Amazon, CD Baby and just about everywhere; you can also buy a CD in a jewel case from Kunaki: https://www.voicesofmusic.org/cds.html
Q.  What is Early Music performance, or historical performance?
A. We play on instruments from the time of the composers, and we use the original music and playing techniques: it’s a special sound.
Q.  Why are there no conductors?
A. Conductors weren’t invented until the 19th century; since we seek to recreate a historical performance, the music is led from the keyboard or violin, or the music is played as chamber music~or both :)
Q.  What are period instruments or original instruments; how are they different from modern instruments?
A. As instruments became modernized in the 19th century, builders and players tended to focus on the volume of sound and the stability of tuning. Modern steel strings replaced the older materials, and instruments were often machine made. Historical instruments, built individually by hand and with overall lighter construction, have extremely complex overtones—which we find delightful. Modern instruments are of course perfectly suited to more modern music.
Q. Why is the pitch lower, or higher?
A. Early Music performance uses many different pitches, and these pitches create different tone colors on the instruments. See https://goo.gl/pVBNAC

Performed on original instruments by San Francisco Early Music Ensemble Voices of Music. Featuring Katherine Kyme, Carla Moore & Cynthia Freivogel, baroque violin; Tanya Tomkins, baroque cello, Hanneke van Proosdij, baroque organ; David Tayler, theorbo.
About the performance: the canon is played using not only the instruments but also the bowing techniques from the time of Pachelbel. As you can see from the video, especially if you look at the high definition version, the string instruments are not only baroque, but they are in baroque setup: this means that the strings, fingerboard, bridge and other parts of the violin appear just as they did in Pachelbel's time. No metal hardware such as chinrests, clamps or fine tuners are used on the violins, allowing the violins to vibrate freely. A good example of baroque bowing can be seen in the extended passage of repeated notes: the musicians play these notes on one bow—the shorter & lighter baroque bow—to created a gliding effect. The players also hold the bow very differently which affects the balance and touch. Both the style and the amount of vibrato are based on baroque treatises which describe the methods for playing, bowing & articulation in the late 17th century. The narrow, shimmering vibrato blends with the baroque organ. The organ used is made entirely of wood, based on German baroque instruments, and the pipes are voiced to provide a smooth accompaniment to the strings, instead of a more soloistic sound. Another feature of the video is the subtle differences in not only the sound and color of the instruments, but also the different techniques of the players. All three are playing baroque violins with baroque bows, yet each person has her own distinct sound and bowing style—each bow has a different shape and balance. If you look at paintings of 17th century players you will see that they are all different, because that individuality of sound and technique was highly valued. This allows the players and the listeners to hear and appreciate the ""Voices of Music.""

Many comments refer to the pitch. D Major is a key, not a pitch; this piece is in D Major at A=415.3 Hz. We chose a baroque pitch and temperament from the time of Pachelbel. You can see the original manuscript that we played from here, clearly in the key of D Major with two sharps http://voicesofmusic.org/images/PachelbelKey.jpg

Glenn Gould was 28 years old here.

For the impatient, Gould's performance begins at 5:08, but I strongly encourage you to watch Leonard Bernstein's fascinating introduction.

This film originally aired in 1960 on CBS Television as part of its ""Ford Presents"" series. 

The entire film in high quality (of which this clip is a small part) was painstakingly hunted down by YouTuber erp65 and his friends. It can be found here, and I urge you, I really DO urge you, to see it in its entirety:

https://youtu.be/9Nx09pigZRI

I have sought erp65's permission to cross-post, as a courtesy, but I have not yet heard back. Meanwhile, my abject enthusiasm got the better of me. 

This film has to be promulgated far and wide. This was erp65's entire intention here, and we owe him and his friends enormous thanks.

She, she loved me so much
And I, I still love her now
Together we both went through

Many closed doors

She, how could I explain it well
She was my whole world back then

We hadn't had much time to learn the ways

From some wise old men
From stories of love, stolen from poets

She, who knows where she's now
Who knows where she's going
I lost her and never again
Would I get to see her

Sometimes and when the sun goes down
I hear a song from afar

Yes, I'd go
Somewhere to find my home
Away from those
Who stole my light and let me roam

Dreams are binding please that wind us so apart
That's hard to find back
Handcuffs all around my neck and thorny wires
That have been tying my heart

And yes, I'd go
Somewhere to build my home
Away from those
Whos stole my light and let me roam

Time is up they will start coming so maybe
It's time for me to pack
To leave behind my whole life is hard
So wish me luck - yeah, wish me luck!

Take them away from me
Or should we fight? But goddamn right -
We're two, they're always three
 
But say so -oh-
Say that you'll come with me
If not true love
Then what's to keep me fighting

Tell me that we will be alright
Tell me that we will do just fine

And yes, I'd go
Anywhere with you
I found my home
It's your light! You guide me through!

Get up my love

Deus e eu
(Jonny)
Jonny


Quando a tempestade chegou
E as lágrimas rolaram 
Quando aquele amor me deixou
E os amigos foram embora
Só ficou o primeiro amor, primeiro amor

Deus e eu... Deus e eu... Deus e eu...
Deus e eu... Deus e eu... Deus e eu... 

Depressa vejo a vida passar
Só não passa o amor 
Inútil me apegar às pessoas
Ao ouro e à prata
Pois no fim só restará, só restará

Deus e eu... Deus e eu... Deus e eu...
Deus e eu... Deus e eu... Deus e eu...

Só o amor transforma o meu eu em nós
Amor aos meus irmãos 
É o que valerá quando estiver 
 Deus e eu... Deus e eu... Deus e eu..

Ela deve ta olhando de lado
Tão sem graça vendo o presente e o passado

Faça ela feliz, faça ela feliz!

Você não vai conhecer alguém melhor que ela
Promete pra mim
O que você jurar pra ela
Você vai cumprir

F.Charm - Departe de tine

Versuri:

Pre-refren:
Am să-ți spun ce simt
Noi ne iubeam pân' la cer
Și-acum chiar nu te mint
Mă pierd în lume fără reper

And I say

Refren:
E-o lume mare, mult prea mare fără tine mă pierd
Atâtea fiare și animale e-o junglă de ciment
Prin labirint mă tot plimb dar nu găsesc să te schimb
Și zile-ntregi mă-ntreb și simt cum am putut să te mint

Bridge:
Ți-am tăiat aripile și n-ai mai zburat mama
Acum regret n-a fost dinadins
Într-o secundă ai dispărut și m-a cuprins teama
Și-o durere de nedescris
Tu știi că vreau să te aduc înapoi (vino înapoi)
Tu știi că vreau să te aduc înapoi (vino înapoi)

Refren

Strofa:
Ai să regreți și știi că
Sufletu-ți poartă pică
Sunt omul tare, care
Când cade se ridică
Privirea-n față-n zare
Fiindcă-i o lume mare
Caut scăpare se pare, rup foi din calendare
Dar eu strig ""Fuck the World!"" din asta n-o să mor
Chiar dacă-n unele zile mi se mai face dor
Și ca un bun actor orice scenariu ai să-mi dai
Știu să-l joc și fără grai
Căci eram Bonnie and Clyde

Refren

Strofa:
Și nimeni n-o să schimbe
Noi doi ne-am iubit
Inima era a ta
Dar acum s-a răzgândit
Și nimeni n-o să schimbe
Noi doi ne-am iubit
Inima-mi bătea prea tare
Dar acum s-a liniștit
Și știi că
Am devenit o stâncă
Căci rana e adâncă
Și dacă-aș vrea să schimb nu pot
În mintea mea ești încă
Dar știu că ce-i rău va trece
Și sper să-ți fie bine când ți-e greu
Când lângă tine nu sunt eu

Versuri :

Refren:

Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Cateodata mai gresesc
Ca nu-i usor
Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Da’ oamenii mai si gresesc
Intamplator

Strofa 1:

Am ales sa fiu o voce , nu doar un ecou
Am ales sa fiu acelasi om de sub tricou
Am ales sa mor in arta, nu ingropat in aur
Am ales sa am onoare, 9 mai sange de taur
Am ales sa fiu ciocan sa bat la cap cuie
Am ales sa am cheia ce sufletu-l descuie
Am ales cu inima ce nu mi-o pierd prin dresuri
Am ales sa fiu medicament sa vindec prin versuri
N-am ales ales mai multe fete ca-mi ajunge una
N-am ales sa fug de trasnet cand plange furtuna
N-am ales calea usoara , drumul fara spini
N-am ales gradina aia mare cu nuferi si crini
Am ales in viata statutul de revolver
Ca n-am vrut sa fiu glontul ce il ghideaza el
Am ales sa nu ma mint atunci cand dau de bine
Sa-mi fac zilnic cadoul de a fi sincer cu mine

Refren:

Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Cateodata mai gresesc
Ca nu-i usor
Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Da’ oamenii mai si gresesc
Intamplator

Strofa 2:

Am ales sa nu port ura, ca ura naste ura
Am ales sa fiu atent la tot ce scot pe gura
Am ales sa ma trezesc in timp ce altii dorm
Am ales sa iubesc muzica cu nopti de nesomn
Am ales sa nu ma vad mai mult decat sunt
Am ales o viata simpla cu pret pe cuvant
Am ales sa-ncerc sa fiu exemplu separat de turma
C-atunci cand voi pleca d-aici sa las ceva in urma
N-am ales foarte atent acele persoane
Ce-au plecat de langa mine cand eram in foame
Am ales sa zbor printre parasute gol
Dar a mea nu s-a deschis si m-am lovit de sol
Am ales gresit odata tot de frica fricii
Si-am sfarsit convins ca-i bine sa am si vicii
Am ales tot ce-am ales sa simt ca traiesc

Yo: 
All the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart
Ohhh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying
Oh my ohhh, well I ain't!

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Kelly: 

All the times that you had to check my phone
The failed attempts to quit that shit that you smoke
Always stumbling in with makeup on your shirt
You think I don't know that you still talk to her
And you told me you were movin on
You just don't want anyone thinking you still care but you still keep them screenshots
And I guess you just loved you more
All your boys told me how you wanted something real but I guess I wasn't good enough

My daddy gon' kill you when he hears this song
He knows that you lied to me, he's glad to see you gone
You're just so messed up in your mind, you cannot see what's inside mine
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 
No I don't like, the way, you played me out 
Maybe you can go and fuck yourself
and if you think that I'm still holdin on to something 
Baby you can go and fuck yourself

Yo: 

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

The Nocturnes, Op. 9 are a set of three nocturnes written by Frédéric Chopin between 1830 and 1832 and dedicated to Madame Camille Pleyel. The work was published in 1833.
This nocturne has a rhythmic freedom that came to characterise Chopin's later work. The left hand has an unbroken sequence of quavers in simple arpeggios throughout the entire piece, while the right hand moves with freedom in patterns of eleven, twenty, and twenty-two notes.
The opening section moves into a contrasting middle section, which flows back to the opening material in a transitional passage where the melody floats above seventeen consecutive bars of D-flat major chords. The reprise of the first section grows out of this and the nocturne concludes peacefully with a Picardy third.",470,331,0,0,26729,2010-11-30 19:20:46,0,"Chopin Nocturne, Artur Rubinstein, Piano Nocturne, Frederic Chopin",F.

0,HD Classical Music,52,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Maurice Ravel completed his String quartet in F major in early April 1903 at the age of 28. Dedicated to his friend and teacher Gabriel Fauré, the work was introduced in Paris by the Heymann Quartet on March 5, 1904. The quartet follows a strict four movement classical structure: Moderato très doux begins as a sonata form allegro, the following Assez vif-Très rythmé functions as the quartet's scherzo, while Très lent acts as a contrasting foil. The last movement, Vif et agité, reintroduces themes from the earlier passages and ends with a striking finale.

History

The Quartet in F major was Ravel's final submission to the Prix de Rome and the Conservatoire de Paris. The composition was rejected by both institutions soon after its premier on March 5, 1904. The quartet received mixed reviews from the Parisian press and local academia. Gabriel Fauré, to whom the work is dedicated, described the last movement as ""stunted, badly balanced, in fact a failure."" Ravel himself commented on the work, ""My Quartet in F major responds to a desire for musical construction, which undoubtedly is inadequately realized but which emerges much more clearly than in my preceding compositions."" As a result of major criticism and rejection, a frustrated Ravel left the Conservatoire in 1905 following what was later called the Ravel Affair.

Ravel's loss during the 1904 Prix de Rome and rejection from the Conservatoire de Paris catapulted his career not backwards but forward: a sympathetic public rallied behind his compositions and musical style. In 1905, Claude Debussy wrote to Ravel: ""In the name of the gods of music and in my own, do not touch a single note you have written in your Quartet."" Ravel's string Quartet in F major stands as one of the most widely performed chamber music works in the classical repertoire, representing Ravel's early achievements and rise from obscurity. On CD, it is often coupled with Debussy's own string quartet.

Movements

1. Allegro moderato. Très doux
2. Assez vif. Très rythmé
3. Très lent
4. Vif et agité

Use in modern media

A rendering of the second movement of Ravel's Quartet in F Major by the Ysaÿe Quartet was used in Wes Anderson's film The Royal Tenenbaums and in the audio addition to the Madacy Entertainment distribution of Fritz Lang's film Metropolis. It has been used as well in one of the first scenes of William Friedkin's film Sorcerer, in which French actor Bruno Cremer eats at a restaurant. It was also used as the main theme for the British television drama The Camomile Lawn.

On Andrew Bird's album, Music of Hair, the song ""Minor Beatrice"" borrows directly from Ravel's piece.

Composing at the piano was a life-long preoccupation for Stravinsky, whose music for the instrument spanned a forty-year period, and reflected his distinct stylistic changes, his associated domestic and financial status and the geo-political situations in which he lived. Thus, prior to his trilogy of pre-war Russian ballets, his piano music up to 1908 might be regarded largely as imitative and can be viewed very much through the lens of other composers. It was as a twenty-year-old law student at St Petersburg University that Stravinsky first showed his earliest piano pieces to Rimsky-Korsakov - whose son Vladimir was there also as a law student. In the agitated rhythms of the modest ternary form Scherzo in G minor of 1902 Stravinsky shows considerable promise and, in its harmonic vocabulary, a debt to Tchaikovsky. 

A year later Stravinsky began his ambitious four-movement Piano Sonata in F sharp minor, turning again to Rimsky-Korsakov for help when his inexperience of large-scale structures led him into difficulties with its formal organization. Here, Tchaikovsky and also Glazunov are influences although Stravinsky recalls of this early sonata in later years that it was ‘an inept imitation of Beethoven’. Possibly this first effort points more to a composer attempting to use traditional Germanic models for his own ends, rather than any direct borrowing of Beethoven. While there are, of course, no specific traces of Beethoven, one can hear in the sonata’s outer movements a dramatic weight and, if a little uncharitably, a certain failure to foreshorten over-used material. It is, however, in the infectious Vivo and elegant charm of the Andante (with its echoes of Rachmaninov) that supporters of this posthumously published work will be found.",23,1672,0,0,1031,2016-01-31 08:54:14,0,"medtnaculus, jai, owners, jai owners, piano, orchestra, symphony, romantic, late romantic, impressionist, modernist, scriabin, debussy, ravel, rachmaininoff, sonata, 20th century, 19th century, fyreaxinoff, hexameron, olla-vogala, olla, vogala, score, sheet, music, igor, stravinsky, igor stravinsky, piano sonata, f sharp minor, 1904, allegro, scherzo, andante, 1903, Piano Sonata in F-Sharp Minor, complete, full",Igor Stravinsky ‒ Piano Sonata in F-Sharp Minor,BjGwIwmv-lY,128400,CN4CEAA,f,0,16,1,31,31,6,5.108565023732835,1.934498451243568,3.0132586652835167,1.3617278360175928,5,4,0.07086681547619048,310,-0.00833333333333334,38,-0.05,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,0,5,4,1,0,4,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,47,0.5898444379752115,0.3786774646611089,2.21282005521446,1,0,0.0

G.-F. Händel ( 1685 - 1759) 
Aria ""Ombra mai fù "" ( 1 Act ) from the Opera ""Serse"" (HWV 40), first performed in London at the King's Theatre, Haymarket , on 15 April 1738. 
The libretto is adapted by an unknown hand from that by Silvio Stampiglia for an earlier opera of the same name by Giovanni Bononcini in 1694. Stampiglia's libretto was itself based on one by Nicolò Minato that was set by Francesco Cavalli in 1654.
The main role of the Persian King Xerxes sang Gaetano Majorano (Caffarelli), it was his first and only one season (1737 / 38 ) on the London stage, and Händel composed for his new Primo Uomo the roles of Faramondo ( premiered on 3th. January 1738, 8 performances) , Serse ( only 5 performances) and in pasticcio ""Alessandro severo"". 
Unlike his other operas for London, Händel included comic (buffo) elements in ""Serse"" , but this Opera wasn´t an success because of "" the libretto not old enough "" and "" the music too modern "". 
Caffarelli left London quite disappointed.

Frédéric Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21, was composed in 1830, before he had finished his formal education — he was around 20 years old. It was first performed on 17 March 1830, in Warsaw, Poland, with the composer as soloist. It was the second of his piano concertos to be published (after the Piano Concerto No. 1), and so was designated as ""No. 2,"" although it was written first.

The work contains the three movements typical of instrumental concertos of the period:
1. Maestoso
2. Larghetto
3. Allegro

The Four Seasons (Italian: Le quattro stagioni) is a set of four violin concertos by Antonio Vivaldi. Composed in 1725, The Four Seasons is Vivaldi's best-known work, and is among the most popular pieces in the classical music repertoire. The texture of each concerto is varied, each resembling its respective season. For example, ""Winter"" is peppered with silvery pizzicato notes from the high strings, calling to mind icy rain, whereas ""Summer"" evokes a thunderstorm in its final movement, which is why the movement is often called ""Storm"" (as noted in the list of derivative works).

The concertos were first published in 1725 as part of a set of twelve concerti, Vivaldi's Op. 8, entitled Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione (The Contest Between Harmony and Invention). Vivaldi dedicated their publication to a Bohemian patron, Count Václav Morzin (of Vrchlabí 1676--1737), and in so mentioned the count's longstanding regard for these four, in particular (which had apparently been performed with the nobleman's orchestra, in Prague's Morzin Palace)—although his dedication may have been closely related to the completion of an Augustinian monastery that year, where Vivaldi, a priest himself, refers to Morzin, the church's dedicator, as ""Chamberlain and Counsellor to His Majesty, the Catholic Emperor""—while (as Maestro di Musica in Italy) Vivaldi presents them anew, with sonnets or enhancements for clear interpretation. The first four concertos are designated Le quattro stagioni, each being named after a season. Each one is in three movements, with a slow movement between two faster ones (and these movements likewise vary in tempo amid the seasons as a whole). At the time of writing The Four Seasons, the modern solo form of the concerto had not yet been defined (typically a solo instrument and accompanying orchestra). Vivaldi's original arrangement for solo violin with string quartet and basso continuo helped to define the form of the concerto.

Sonnets and allusions

There is some debate as to whether the four concertos were written to accompany four sonnets or vice versa. Though it is not known who wrote these sonnets, there is a theory that Vivaldi wrote them himself, given that each sonnet is broken down into three sections, neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Whoever wrote the sonnets, The Four Seasons may be classified as program music, instrumental music that intends to evoke something extra-musical and an art form which Vivaldi was determined to prove sophisticated enough to be taken seriously.

In addition to these sonnets, Vivaldi provided instructions such as ""The barking dog"" (in the second movement of ""Spring""), ""Languor caused by the heat"" (in the first movement of ""Summer""), and ""the drunkards have fallen asleep"" (in the second movement of ""Autumn""). The Four Seasons is used in the 1981 film The Four Seasons along with other Vivaldi concertos for flute.

""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" is the title of a song by American gangsta rapper Dr. Dre, from his debut solo album, The Chronic. It features rapper Snoop Dogg and is the first single from the album. ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 (Informer by Snow topped the charts when the song went to its highest peak on the week of March 20, 1993), outperforming The Chronic's other singles ""Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')"" (number 8) and ""Let Me Ride"" (number 34). The single also reached number one on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. It was also a hit in the UK, where it reached number 31. The song was selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. XXL magazine named it the top hip hop song of the decade.
The song samples ""I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You"" by Leon Haywood and was based after the life of James Adkins.

Background

The vocals are shared by Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg (who has sole songwriting credit), who drop in trademark references to Long Beach and Compton in California. The song contains samples from Leon Haywood's ""I Wanna Do Something Freaky to You"", B-Side Wins Again by Public Enemy and ""Uphill (Peace of Mind)"" by Kid Dynamite. On the inside cover of The Chronic album under Credits, Leon Haywood's name is incorrectly cited as ""L. Hayward""
""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" is listed in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It's Dre's only song on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (ranked number 419), not counting two other songs that feature Dre as producer and on vocals, N.W.A.'s ""Fuck tha Police"" and 2Pac's ""California Love"". Q magazine listed it as the 24th greatest hip-hop song of all time. In September 2010 Pitchfork Media included the song at number 3 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s.

Derivative versions

Kris Kross heavily sampled Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang on their 1993 single I'm Real.
Snoop Dogg's first single from ""Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told"" was a sequel to the song entitled, ""Still a G Thang.""
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg retooled ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" into the titular theme of their 2001 comedy film The Wash.
""Get It Up"" by Silkk the Shocker uses the reworked chorus of ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang.""
Ja Rule's ""Livin' It Up"" contains a sample of ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"". It was nominated for a Grammy Award.
There also is a radio edit, where most of the profanity is removed by changes in lyrics.
The song was parodied by The Fringemunks to recap Fringe episode 2.04, ""Momentum Deferred."" 
Funny or Die posted a parody in January 2011 called ""Nuthin' But A Glee Thang"", about the TV series Glee co-written by Glee castmember Heather Morris and co-starring Sofia Vergara, Riki Lindhome and Ashley Lendzion and features Glee castmates Matthew Morrison, Cory Monteith, Harry Shum, Jr. & Naya Rivera.

Music video

The music video (directed by Andre Young) depicts Dr. Dre coming into Long Beach, California to pick up Snoop Dogg and go to a block party. They arrive at the party where they perform the first verses outside, while a barbecue cookout and a game of volleyball goes on. A female player's bikini top is pulled down, exposing her breasts. For the next verses they go inside the house where the party is taking place. A small sequence of events shows a snobbish female party-goer humiliated by being sprayed with shaken-up malt liquor. The video ends with Dre dropping Snoop off back at his house, with Snoop staggering up the driveway. The MTV edit censors nudity, drug paraphernalia (Warren G with a blunt), copyrighted logos (White Sox ball cap), and screen text.

INFINITE H _ Special girl (feat.Bumkey)
コンセプトイメージの公開からティーザー公開、そしてヒップホップ界の最もホットなアーティストたちが集大成したトラックリストまで、連日話題の中心となっていたインフィニットHのミニアルバム[FLY HIGH]が2013年1月11日その実体を現わした。

天才プロデューサープライマリーがインフィニットHの音楽プロデューサーとして合流、インフィニットHと疎通しながら音楽のスケッチを開始、そこに実力とトレンディにおいて最高のアーティストたちが続々と参加し音楽を具体化していった。

タイトルナンバー「Special Girl」は、インフィニットHだけの長所が引き立つポップトラックだ。インフィニットHはミディアムテンポの中で自然で自由にメロディカルなラップを披露する。特にR＆Bボーカリスト'ボムキ'がフィーチャリンに参加し、ビンジノが歌詞とディレクティング作業に参加して曲を輝かせてくれた。

컨셉 이미지 공개에서부터 티저 공개. 힙합씬의 가장 핫한 아티스트들이 집대성 된 트랙리스트까지 연일 화제의 중심에 섰던 인피니트H의 미니 앨범 [FLY HIGH]가 2013년 1월 11일 실체를 드러냈다.

천재 프로듀서 프라이머리가 인피니트H의 음악 프로듀서로 합류하면서 인피니트H와의 소통을 통해 음악 스케치를 시작했고 거기에 실력과 트렌디에 관해선 둘째가라면 서러워할 아티스트들이 속속 합류하면서 음악은 구체화를 띄기 시작했다.

타이틀 넘버 'Special Girl'은 인피니트H만의 장점이 돋보이는 팝 트랙이다. 미디움 템포 안에서 자연스럽고, 자유롭게 인피니트H가 뛰어놀 듯 멜로디컬한 랩을 선보인다. 특히 R&B 보컬리스트 범키가 피춰링으로 참여해주었고 빈지노가 가사작업과 디렉팅 작업에 참여해 곡을 빛내 주었다.",605,256,0,1,41746,2013-01-11 03:00:13,0,"인피니트, 로엔, 로엔뮤직, 로엔티비, 울림, 호야, 동우, 뮤비, 플라이 하이, 티져, infinite, loen, loenmusic, loentv, woollim, hoya, dongwoo, mv, fly high, teaser, kpop, music, 힙합, hip hop, Special gilr",INFINITE H _ Special girl (feat.Bumkey) MV,b281MAGI5G0,3114549,CGQQAA,h,0,13,1,11,11,4,6.493395167851744,3.3384564936046046,4.620614868774087,2.781755374652469,6,2,0.4944957983193278,230,0.4390476190476191,24,0.35714285714285715,6,1,2,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,42,0.7115868893441701,0.5141311143564808,1.6610428475765415,0,1,0.0

Lyrics:
Severed head syndrome.
Watching the seer come on.
Ready to be like a shattered bone.
Once in the nape it can't be undone.

Cover with leaves where you've gone.
Watching the lace scar and the color come.
Reaching the ridge with a thumb.
Why won't you make it ever so?

I've been waiting for you everyday.
Just inside there you can stay.
When you see me please don't look away.
Once you're bound you're never leaving.",51,378,0,1,2665,2013-07-31 15:16:36,0,"True Widow, SHS, S:H:S, TRUE WIDOW NEW SONG, TRUE WIDOW NEW ALBUM, TRUE WIDOW OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO, TRUE WIDOW 2013, CIRCUMAMBULATION, True Widow Band, SHOEGAZE, STONER METAL, TRUE WIDOW CIRCUMAMBULATION, RELAPSE RECORDS, TEXAS ROCK, Stonegaze, True widow shs, Alternative, slowgaze, slowcore, psychadelic, psychadelic rock","TRUE WIDOW -""S:H:S"" (Official Music Video)",QBc7739ZkxE,275986,CMgBEAA,h,0,13,7,31,212,2,5.440887052076241,2.184691430817599,3.425697213362591,1.7075701760979365,5,31,0.1875,106,0.3072727272727273,20,0.35,5,0,1,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,42,0.6296210857851472,0.401532215226545,2.0061823878833738,0,0,0.0

0,AYAX Y PROK,1182,es,1,"Hace 8 años presente esta poesía en el concurso del instituto, lo gane y me compre una bola.. jaja No he cambiado ni una sola palabra. Nunca lo he grabado porque es muy personal y me cuesta hablar de mujeres y  desamor, aunque también me inspire a escribir... H FLAKA es mi primo de sangre Hector y mientras que iba al baño durante la grabación empezó a cantar de broma Frank Sinatra encima de la base, al escucharlo desde el baño decide escribir un estribillo en inglés que pegara con ese rollo e incluirlo, luego hice una traducción del mismo y la cante a mi manera...salió como salen las cosas autenticas, improvisadas! y estoy muy contento con el resultado... Gracias a Gabriel Escobar por grabarlo y mezclarlo con una famosa base de Necro y a Soker por el video! El video tiene alguna errata, porque se ha hecho sin mucho tiempo y la carencia de acentuaciones se debe a que no lo permitía el tipo de tipografía. Doy gracias a la poesía...Solo con esto parece que vuelva a casa... Dedicado al Loto Negro.

Lyrics :

Bridge:
1 ngày nào đó em sẽ nhận ra những lời anh nói, 
Mong là vào lúc đó em đang nằm trên giường bệnh trăn trối, 
Ở 20 tuổi, anh mong em không thể ăn dù bụng rất đói, 
Mong em chết vì bị bệnh tim quả báo em khiến tim anh nhức nhói, 

Hook:

Man I hope you happy with the things that I'd know,
Don't let the karma hit you when you heading out the door,
I got a hundred problems and they all including you,
But I love you, I don't even know what to do, 

Fuck your bullshit and your sorry, 
Don't even try to call me, 
Fuck your bullshit and your sorry, 
Bet you thought that I was blind but I could see, 
thru your bullshit and your lies,

Verse 1:

Anh mang con tim trên tay, trao em để em được thấy, 
Họ trao con tim bằng giấy, phút chốc làm em quên ngay, 
Có lẽ là nên như vậy, và anh chúc em hạnh phúc,
Cần sa đưa anh lên mây, em đưa anh xuống địa ngục, 
Nơi mà em được tạo ra, với bao điều xảo trá, 
Em là cáo già, virus của tạo hoá, 
Nguồn sống của em là, những thứ anh trao ra,
Lời nói em bao la, và sặc mùi cao cả, 
Em nói đừng lo lắng gì cả, anh tưởng em nói thằng đó là bạn thân, 
Anh tưởng em nói rằng nó là anh cả, anh đâu biết gu của em là loạn luân, 
Em ơi em có bao giờ từng tin vào quả báo? Anh chống mắt chờ của em nhìn ra sao, 
Em ơi bịa láo ông táo sẽ bẻ răng, em có bao giờ nghe thấy câu ca dao?
Anh đâu hề thấy làn da em màu đỏ, cái đuôi hình muỗi tên, cặp sừng của con dê,
Nói diêm vương chừa sẵn em 1 chỗ cái ngày em quay về. 

Bridge:

Anh chỉ mong 1 ngày nào đó em sẽ nhận ra những lời anh nói, 
Mong là vào lúc đó em đang nằm trên giường bệnh trăn trối, 
Ở 20 tuổi, anh mong em không thể ăn dù bụng rất đói, 
Mong em chết vì bị bệnh tim quả báo em khiến tim anh nhức nhói, 

Hook:

Man I hope you happy with the things that I'd know,
Don't let the karma hit you when you heading out the door,
I got a hundred problems and they all including you,
But I love you, I don't even know what to do, 

Fuck your bullshit and your sorry, 
Don't even try to call me, 
Fuck your bullshit and your sorry, 
Bet you thought that I was blind but I could see, 
thru your bullshit and your lies,


Ver 2 : 

em ơi anh yêu em lắm ... tai nạn anh hứa đi thăm 
đêm khuya em nhớ thức tắm ... ăn rau muống sau khi xăm
anh biết anh biết em ho ... đi bay về sớm anh lo 
ho thì phải nhớ hút cỏ ... nhớ uống thuốc đừng có uống khi no
nếu anh có nước trong tay... phòng em bị cháy không ai biết hay
sao thể bạc tình như vậy ... anh vừa đánh răng ... vừa đứng ngắm em cháy
tim anh em lấy em chơi ... quả báo đến sớm em ơi 
không cần chờ đến kiếp sau ... không chừng em thức giấc là ngày mai nó tới
như là chết đuối khi đang bơi ... cá mập nó cắn khi ra khơi 
chơi nhầm thuốc giả mà qua đời ... chết vì kiệt sức khi đang chơi
yêu toàn thằng chó ... được chốc lát rồi chia tay
đéo thằng nào em tha ... đến bạn anh em cũng lầy
anh không phải bến thuyền đợi chờ em như đã tính
anh không phải giường êm để đêm đêm em ngã mình
anh không phải bị mù mà không thấy em đi thả thính
nếu quay về lúc quen em anh sẽ tự vả mình
nhẹ dạ cả tin trong suốt quá trình anh vẫn là thằng bại binh...
những lời em nói anh coi như chưa từng nghe
chúc em hạnh phúc đêm hôm đi coi chừng xe",3145,259,0,1,67218,2017-02-21 05:01:40,0,"Roy Lyrics, Roy lyrics, roylyrics, B.S.N.L 2 - B-RAY ft.

Release Info: 
[PD033] Elemental Progressions Volume 2 - Fall 2014 Our first installment of this series last summer was a huge success, charting at the top 5 of Beatport's Trance charts for 12 weeks. We proudly present to you the second installment of our next Elemental Progressions compilation for your listening pleasures with 12 new exceptional tracks from 12 artists who are part of the Pineapple Digital family. To top off the icing on this cake our label boss Dave Pineda, has taken his talents once again and mixed the tracks in perfected key for a non stop continuous flow of sheer epicness! His mix is only available as a bonus with the purchase of the complete album. 1: Ryo Nakamura - Luminescent, Ryo brings us gently whispered vocals and an intricately balanced composition and stays in true amazing form. Ryo shows us his soul and exposes the naked truth below. 2: Puru - Toki, Puru was selected with one of our earliest highly successfu releases with Toki, it is so darn good we just thought hey lets give it another whirl. Enjoy once again the magic Puru instills with this massive electronic beast! 3: Kono (USA) - Wild Sapphire, Brady brings us this brand new and exclusive track Wild sapphire. This one is for sure a gem that sparkles bright and shines bright. A multi faceted melodic stunner with an epic breakdown to wrench the soul. 4: Zani0 - Bloom, Zani0 is new to the PD crew, he hails in from Tokyo, Japan to deliver a slice of himself direct to your ears and heart. With magical intrumentals and a ghostly vocal this ones a great addition we reckon. 5: Almer - Blue Sky, Far into the cloud bursts and beyond the rainbows lies inner strenth and beauty. Here you find clear Blue Skies from Almer, enriched with melodies to take your breath away and keep you soaring high. 6: Veeshy - Solar Breath, space, time and stars infinite all wrapped up tight in this unearthly goodness. Synths, pianos, bass its all here in a Solar Breath. 7: Blood Groove and Kikis - Silver Sand, Hereeee weee gooo! Yes we have these 2 legends back and in full on form here at PD. BDandK are renowned for their precise and simply spectacular works of art. Silver Sand is a true relection of this and is unreal in every sense of the word. 8: Alex H - Where Stars Collide, Alex H aka Alex Humberstone debuts to at PD, massively with his outstanding new track. Hear it twinkle, listen to it pluck and let it blast you off far far away. 9: Desaicrator and Jay Flora - Stepping Stones, Tip toeing gently into the waters edge this drifts in delicately then progresses into an orchestral grandure with amazing grace. 10: Nihilum - Othala, He's back!! Nihilum in tha house! Othala is yet another beyond epic track created just for our listeners and once again testament to how unreal this guy pumps up the bass and astounds us every single time and throws off the listener with a chillstep twist on the breakdown. 11: Intrinity - Fiji, A little slice of a far off land full of exceptional beauty and fascinations comes to us with Fiji. A techy, punchy electrical storm of a track. Hard hitting and full of life. 12: Smuuf - Scifilite, Deep, deep and deeper this goes, right into the black hole of sound and out the other side with a blast. We hope you enjoy!

0,Maverick H.,773,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Ramón Fernando Villalona Évora (nacido el 7 de mayo de 1955 en Monte Cristi), conocido como ""Fernando Villalona"", apodado cariñosamente ""El mayimbe"" o ""El niño mimado"", es uno de los cantantes más consagrados en la República Dominicana. Aunque originalmente se dio a conocer con los géneros balada y bolero, Villalona ha incursionado exitosamente en géneros como merengue, bachata y últimamente en la música cristiana. Ha grabado más de 20 álbumes, casi todos éxitos rotundos. Villalona comenzó a cantar a temprana edad y se hizo popular después de participar en ""El festival de la voz"", un concurso de televisión en busca de talentos. Después de eso, el icono del merengue Wilfrido Vargas lo contrató para formar parte de su grupo Los Hijos del Rey,1 pero Fernando y el grupo pronto se separarían después de que su popularidad llegara a ser más grande que el propio grupo. Tiempo después entró en un período de drogas y aislamiento, pero nunca dejó de cantar, y siguió grabando durante ese período.

ellos no tienen amigos, solamente objetivos
así que cuídate, de cruzarte en su camino
son acumuladores de odio, no tiene vida propia

Paroles
Putain j'transpire, pire j'suis en transe les transports bloquent ça klaxonne
Ça fait 2 heures qu'j'n'avance qu'à petit feu
Peu à peu je pète les plombs
Le beauf de derrière m'insulte et me traite de con
C'en est trop je sors de ma caisse
Prends mon sac dans l'coffre et m'casse
Laisse ma caisse sur l'périph'
Rien à foutre je trace
Trop de stress, j'ai trop faim il m'faut un Mc Do
J'en trouve un, rentre, il y a une queue de bâtard mais bon j'la fais
30 minutes plus tard environ je demande très poliment :
""Bonjour un Mc Morning s'il vous plaît""
Quand elle me répond :
""Trop tard, désolé monsieur il est midi
Et après midi, eh bien le Mc Morning c'est fini""
J'lui dis : "" Quand j'vous ai demandé il était 11h59
Faites un effort j'veux un Morning salé
Vous savez celui avec l'œuf ""
Elle m'dit : ""Il est midi, j'vous l'ai dit c'est fini
Prenez un Big Mac ou allez voir ailleurs si j'y suis""
J'lui dis : ""Appelez moi l'patron""
""Le patron n'est pas là""
Ajoute: ""Allez chez l'chinois vous pourrez peut-être prendre un plat""
J'lui dis : ""2 secondes"" Sors de mon sac un calibre et la braque
Les gens de derrière qui étaient si impatients maintenant s'écartent
Elle m'dit : ""OK, prenez la caisse, moi j'veux pas mourir
Il y a plein d'billets, plein de pièces""
J'lui dis ""Un Mc Morning où je tire""
3 minutes après ma bouffe est prête
Et j'm'apprête à partir quand la pute me dit :
""J'ai mis un Big Mac""
T'aurais jamais dû l'dire

J'voulais juste un McMorning

J'pète les plombs, putain j'pète les plombs
Putain j'pète les plombs, mais oui j'pète les plombs
J'ai tout perdu : ma femme, mon gosse, mon job
J'ai plus rien à perdre alors suce mon zob !
J'pète les plombs, putain j'pète les plombs
Putain j'pète les plombs, mais oui j'pète les plombs
J'ai tout perdu : ma femme, mon gosse, mon job
J'ai plus rien à perdre alors suce mon zob !

Alors qu'j'suis recherché et qu'les keufs me traquent
V'la qu'une meuf me drague
La go blague, me dit des trucs vagues
Elle m'dit : ""Tu sais qu'tes un beau black ?
Non j't'assure sans déc'
Dès que j't'ai vu j'ai oublié mon mec""
J'lui dis : ""De qui tu t'moques ?
Toi tu veux ma quequette
Tu veux que j'te fuck
Qu'j'dépense plein de petites pepettes
Qu'une fois les couilles vides
J'porte le même jean's
Que tu mettes au beurre toi et tes copines
Avec ma maille vous direz tchin tchin
Salope va voir ailleurs parce que moi j't'ai grillée
Mon ex-femme a fait pareil""
""Et alors ?""
""Alors tu peux t'tailler""
Au moment où j'dis ça le métro s'arrête
Et j'm'apprête à partir
Quand elle a répondu un truc qu'elle aurait pas dû dire
Elle m'dit : ""Non mais pour qui tu t'prends ?
Mais c'est normal qu'elle t'ai jeté
De toute façon avec ta tête de con
Tu devais tout lui acheter""

Et là j'suis un beau black ?

J'pète les plombs, putain j'pète les plombs
Putain j'pète les plombs, mais oui j'pète les plombs
J'ai tout perdu : ma femme, mon gosse, mon job
J'ai plus rien à perdre alors suce mon zob !
J'pète les plombs, putain j'pète les plombs
Putain j'pète les plombs, mais oui j'pète les plombs
J'ai tout perdu : ma femme, mon gosse, mon job
J'ai plus rien à perdre alors suce mon zob !

""J'veux ta veste, tes baskets, ton sac
Ta carte de retrait, ton chéquier et ton sandwich""
C'est c'que l'gars m'a dit alors que j'rentrai au quartier
J'lui dis : ""Laissez moi j'ai passé une sale journée""
Ils m'disent : ""rien à foutre"", s'excitent et s'énervent tout seul
Me sort un mouss, fait l'ouf et d'après lui m'impressione
""J'suis qu'un dingue dans ma tête
C'est un fou dans sa tête !""
J'lui réponds : ""Putain espèce de saltimbanque
Arrêtes ton bluff mec, tu crois qu'tu braques une banque ?
Range ton canif, j'sais pas va faire une manif', va t'acheter un sou-tif
Espèce de petit travelot chétif, pédé""
""Mais attends toi, tu viens de quel quartier ?""
""De té-ci !""
""Faut payer pour sortir entier""
J'lui dis : ""Ecoute mec, rien à foutre que nos quartiers soient en guerre
Attends, j'vais t'payer après t'iras niquer ta mère !""
J'sors de mon sac de hockey un harpon
Il m'dit : ""Ah bon ?""
Moi j'suis l'genre de mec qui pète les plombs
J'ai tout perdu : ma femme, mon gosse, mon job
J'ai plus rien à perdre alors suçe mon zob !
Le gars s'baisse, j'lui dis : ""Mais vas-y casse toi""

The 'King' K. Will who made a huge record for himself last fall with 'You Don't Know Love' is back with his 5th mini-album [One Fine Day]. 

His title song 'Day 1' creates fun grooves on top of minimal drums and rhythmical piano, guitar and bass. Its warm, unique string lines make the song even better. And K. Will's attractive voice, singing about an average guy wanting to win the heart of his love, brings the song to perfection.

昨年の秋に「You don't know love」で8連打ヒットという大記録を達成し、名実共に'音源の帝王'であることを立証したケイウィルが、5枚目のミニアルバム[ONE FINE DAY]で帰ってくる。

リード曲「今日から1日」は、ミニマルなドラム•サウンドの上にリズミカルなピアノ、ギター、ベースが加わって面白いグルーブを生み出し、暖かいながらも個性的なストリングスラインが曲の魅力を倍加させる。好きな女性の心を得たいと思う平凡な男の愛の告白にケイウィルの訴える力濃厚なボイスが加わって曲への没入度をアップさせている。

지난 가을 '촌스럽게 왜 이래'로 8연타 히트라는 대기록을 달성, 명실상부한 '음원의 제왕' 임을 입증한 케이윌이 5번째 미니 앨범 [ONE FINE DAY]로 돌아온다.

타이틀곡 '오늘부터 1일'은 미니멀한 드럼 사운드위에 리드미컬한 피아노,기타,베이스가 더해져 재미있는 그루브를 만들어 내고, 따뜻하면서도 개성 있는 스트링 라인이 곡의 매력을 배가시킨다. 좋아하는 여자의 마음을 얻고 싶은 평범한 보통 남자의 사랑 고백에 케이윌의 호소력 짙은 보이스가 더해져 듣는 하여금 곡의 몰입도가 올라가는 것이 특징이다.",2050,239,0,1,144321,2014-06-26 03:00:00,0,"원더케이, 1theK, 로엔, 로엔티비, 로엔뮤직, loen, loentv, loenmusic, 韓流, 韓国, kpop, artist, mv, teaser, 뮤비, 티져, ロエン, ミュージック, テレビ, ミュージックビデオ, ティーザー, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, エスエフ, シー・エス・アイ, ２４時間前, レッツダンス, 踊り, ダンス, 振付け, インタビュー, イベント, ラントゥユー, ライブ, new song, 신곡, 케이윌, 스타쉽, 씨스타, 소유, 보이프렌드, 오늘부터 1일, day 1, k.will, k will, starship, sistar, soyou, boyfriend",[MV] K.will(케이윌) _ Day 1(오늘부터 1일),9KVVPxexz1c,22080606,CKwCEAA,k,0,14,6,26,177,3,7.344010988388886,3.803115554890027,5.159329529434128,3.3117538610557538,7,26,0.3583333333333333,180,0.13636363636363635,49,0.0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,33,0.7025220329314854,0.5178526503981098,1.5578843555086503,0,0,0.0

[Intro] 
see this here 
this is Crucial, yea 

[Verse 1] 
This is an emergency 
They shot down in the dark 
They did it cause it paid a fee 
Now there's nothing to die for 
All the kids from miles around 
Are fools in paradise 
Don't know about the pirate sound 
So the scene is an eyesore 
Coming back we fly away 
Jah jah coming so I live to see another day 
All I think about if I were just to run away 
Would I come back to love you girl? 

[Hook] 
I don't wanna change the world 
I only want to stop pretending 
What you say? Come again 
What you say? Come again now 
Nothing left to do but let it burn 
I only hope we're all ascending high 
What you say? Come again? 
What you say? Come again now? 

[Verse 2] 
All around my hometown 
They tried to chop me down 
But the truth shall not forsake me 
Take me up to higher ground 
And you-ou-ou-ou-ou 
You're the light when the feeling is dark 
Not pretending the game is a race 
Because you're born and you'll die in my heart 

[Hook] 
I don't wanna change the world 
I only want to stop pretending 
What you say? Come again? 
What you say? Come again now? 

I will never let you down 
I'll be right here beside you, hanging around 
So if you think you let me down 
Leave me here in silence, Without a sound 

Change words 
Ch-Change burns 
We came first
That's why we're in chains 
and there's no one to blame but time.",16,206,0,0,876,2011-12-13 09:49:57,0,Crucial,K-OS - Crucial,8WGZULrMsrk,156642,CKwCEAA,k,0,11,12,13,347,1,5.1949082195523895,1.4471580313422192,2.942504106168081,1.2041199826559248,5,50,0.09416065416065417,263,0.0,0,0.0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,14,0.5664208070304688,0.2785723963121164,2.443696764900293,0,0,0.0

My my, how time gets away from us.
I released the album containing this song to bandcamp in April last year. I'm trying my best to not have any songs still needing to be put on youtube a year after the album released. We'll see how we go...

This song is somewhat of a prequel to the Wanting/Knowing story, and tells the backstory of the royal sisters of that AU, hopefully giving a little insight into why that Celestia is so cold in the main story.

I hope that one day she can feel better.

C                B/C                Am         C
   A second sister unwanted, 
Unwanted by me, unplanned by them
You leeched the magic as you grew,
Of the parents you barely knew. 

And as they faded they made me swear,
Treat your sister with love and care,
If you ever need us we’re in her,
Which just makes looking at you hurt.

C   Am                                       F       
    I hate what you’ve made me do, 
C   Am                                        F       G
    And what you’ve turned me into,
C                                           F
A part of me is now locked away,
       C                   Am                   F
And I hate that it’s all because of you.


The years pass it sets in,
The forced smiles and fake grins,
I raise the sun, you ask me why,
Without you they’d still be alive.

This rebellion of yours could never win,
You don’t know the tide I’m holding in,
You plead to me but it’s no use,
I’ve just been waiting for an excuse,

 C                                                    F
And they will ask where you have gone,
Am                                            G
And I’ll tell stories of nightmare moon,
That you were jealous of the light I shone,
That the villain here was you",0,236,0,0,77,2018-02-21 19:16:28,0,"my little pony, friendship is magic, twilight sparkle, princess luna, twiluna, Pop Music (Musical Genre), Pop Rock (Musical Genre), Pop Punk (Musical Genre), horse music, The Old Mare And The Sea, Celestia, Luna",What You Made Me Do [W/K #0],VA3ls25pNAA,1118,CN4CEAA,k,0,18,2,21,52,2,3.0484418035504044,1.3010299956639813,1.8864907251724816,0.0,3,8,-0.016885964912280706,591,0.06874999999999999,11,0.0,6,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,28,0.6188377035688717,0.4267852494834315,10.0,0,0,0.0

=============
""Otto Jahn dated the work to between November 1780 and March 1781, during Mozart's stay in Munich for a performance of his opera Idomeneo, since it was assumed that Mozart was mostly uninterested in church music during his Vienna years (producing only the unfinished C minor mass as a result of a vow, the unfinished Requiem for a commission, and the very short Ave verum corpus for a friend), and the clarinets in the scoring would not have been available in Salzburg. Hence the work was sometimes called the Münchener Kyrie (Munich Kyrie).This assumption has since been refuted with the discovery of sketches for sections of the Mass by Mozart dating from the late 1780s, and it was suggested in the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe that K. 341 actually dated from Vienna in 1787–91, when Mozart was hoping to be appointed Kapellmeister of St. Stephen's Cathedral. The absence of K. 341 from Mozart's thematic catalogue of his own compositions (the Verzeichnüss aller meiner Werke, that he kept from 1784 to 1791) may be explained if the work was left unfinished, something which is also suggested by some technical flaws in the published score.""

""Jestes Lekiem Na Cale Zlo"" (""You're The Cure For All The Evil"") is the best known song of Krystyna Pronko, a highly talented Polish vocalist born in 1947. I have translated the text, enjoy - and if you want to see the original version, then just scroll your mouse a bit higher.

You keep on writing slogans on my palm
Then remove the marker with a brush
You say that you fear no-one
And if they come you'll eat them... this is you

The leaves fall from trees upside down
You keep wearing the same jacket for the 6th year
On the concerts you yell ""More energy!""
Reading in the bathtub you worsen your sight

You're the cure for all the evil
And the hope for the next year
You're a star in the darkness, world champion in joy
This is you

You're the cure for all the evil
And the hope for the next year
You're the Alpha-Omega, hymn, carrol
This is you... un-named you

When stupidity and poverty finally get me
You're a monkey and my house is a circus
In the eyes the fire's lighting
Only for you I want to live...


You're the cure for all the evil
And the hope for the next year
You're a star in the darkness, world champion in joy
This is you

Serenade No. 6 in D major, K. 239 ""Serenata notturna"" (1776)

00:00 - Marcia. Maestoso

Performed by Jordi Savall and Le Concert des Nations. Recorded by Harmonia Mundi in 2005.

""The 'Serenata notturna' (K. 239), of January 1776, [is composed] for a concertino of two concertante violins, viola, and double bass, and a concerto grosso of string orchestra with timpani. From the standpoint of sound and melody it is one of the most enchanting of Mozart's early works; it consists of a March in 'majestic' tempo, a Minuet, with Trio for the concertino alone, and a Rondo with a graceful, Gallic theme—and one does not feel that any additional movements are required. The Rondo contains two intermezzi: a short Adagio like the stiffest kind of minuet, which has the effect of an introduction to the second, a rustic, primitive Allegro. Both are interpolations and undoubtedly citations that were known to the Salzburg audience; if we knew what they were we should have more definite information about the purpose for which the work was written. These notturni and divertimenti have this in common with the violin concertos: in the final rondos Mozart cracks a little joke for himself and his hearers; he condescends for a moment to the level of 'the people' and makes somewhat of a display of his own aristocratic nature when he returns to his wonted style; he points to rude bucolic beauties and then shows off his own splendid raiment. Not without reason were such serenades or cassations called Final-Musiken; for everyone looked forward to a musical pleasantry of this sort in the finale."" - Alfred Einstein

Lyrics:



There you were freaking out,
Trying to get your head around the fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm trippin out
'cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin?

You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't givin' nothing to me

Es-tu vintage à l'os ? Moi chus vintage à l'os
Si t'es vintage à l'os ? T'as joué à Mario Bros
Es-tu vintage à l'os ? On est vintage à l'os
Pis toi avec si tu te levais pour changer de poste

Es-tu vintage à l'os ? Moi chus vintage à l'os
Si t'es vintage à l'os, tu te souviens d’Éric Lindros
Es-tu vintage à l'os ? Lui est vintage à l'os
 
Être vintage à l'os, c'est pas trop précis 
C'est genre Bobino, les 100 watts, Degrassi 
Les années disco, Sico Sico par ci
 
Steinberg, Kresgee, c't'un état d'esprit
 
Si tu faisais du bike a'ec une carte de Bass' dans ta roue 
Si c'tait toé l'king des wélés pis d'la race dans ta rue
 
T'étais dans Guerre des tuques pis dans Gang des BMX 
T'avais un t-shirt de Maiden, tu lisais Astérix 
 
Les noms d'tes chums c'taient Mélanie ou ben Éric 
Le dernier gadget à mode c'était un cube Rubik 
Quand ça fumait dins écoles, quand t'avais pas d'NIP 
Quand t'allais au Perrette poigner des Mini-sips 
 
Si t'avais un support su' ta tv comme antenne
 
Tu recevais 12 cassettes par la poste pour une cenne 
Y avait les Nordiques pis y avait les Expos 
Y avait la O'Keefe pis la Molson Export 
 
T'attendais après décembre pour Ciné-Cadeau
 
Quand y avait un pit de sable à place des condos
 
Le Big Wheel, le Jerrold, le Spraynet, le Pacman
 
Gilligan, le Walkman, la vieille série Batman 
 
Si ta mère t'envoyait à l'école sur du Passe-Partout 
Faisait ton Kraft Dinner devant Fred Cailloux 
Ça te coûtait 25 cents quand tu prenais l'bus
Ça confirme que toé itou t'es vintage à l'os 

Es-tu vintage à l'os ? Moi chus vintage à l'os
Si t'es vintage à l'os ? T'as joué à Mario Bros
Es-tu vintage à l'os ? On est vintage à l'os

Si t'es vintage à l'os, tu te souviens d’Éric Lindros
Es-tu vintage à l'os ? Lui est vintage à l'os
Parce qu'il a porté des jeans à l'envers dans le temps d'Kris Kross

Si t'es vintage à l'os, tu vas t'souvenir aussi
 
D'la STCUM, Berri-De Montigny 
Mais si tu t'en souviens pas, t’es vintage itou
 
T'as connu avant Laval le terminus d'Henri-Bou 
 
Pour toé Sylvie Léonard c'est Traboulidon 
T'avais un siège banane, des franges sur ton guidon 
Capotais quand le câble annonçait qu'ils débrouillent

Assis dans le salon du Map-O-Spread sur tes toasts
 
La poutine dans c'temps-là, c’était rien qu'une frite sauce

L'émeute de la coupe Stanley sur Sainte-Cath au Forum 
Parc Belmont, Terre des Hommes, l'Aqua Parc, Floralies 
Le zoo du parc La Fontaine, Village de Nathalie 

Si tu soupais devant Michel Louvain
 
Que t’allais te coucher avant Michel Jasmin
 
Pis qu'avec ton Big Wheel tu jumpais dins bosses 
Ça prouve que toé itou t'es vintage à l'os

Si t’as payé des frais de retard au club vidéo
Que finalement ça t'coûte le double pour checker Rambo
Pis si en plus t'avais oublié de le « Rambobiner »
Quand tu regardes ça aujourd'hui, t'es bien content de streamer

T'as connu MSN, pis les téléphones à cadran
Les floppy disks, les Betamax pis Super Écran
Si pour toé, si l'épisode 4 ça a toujours été l'premier
Ça prouve que t'es vintage, ça sert à rien de le nier

Si t'allais chez Direct Film pour développer tes photos
 
Pis que l'dernier des Rocky c'était celui contre Drago 
Si t'appelles encore ça Hull pis qu'c'est rendu Gatineau
T'es un Génie en herbe, v'là deux morceaux d'robots

T'as connu l'avant TPS, tu te perdais pas sans GPS 
T'avais ton carnet d’adresses pis tu payais en espèces
 
Dans c'temps-là au secondaire c'était les Export A Light 
On avait pas d'iPad mais on avait des Light Bright

Ça se passait dans l'parc ou ben donc dans ruelle

Misleading me 
When lights are awake 
What I can see 
Is just a shade of you

And you know 
I only feel you through 
The scent 
Of the wave 

Finding the key 
While touching the air 
Soft odyssey 
Delusive is the view 

And you know

Of the wave

Letras:

Unas piernas que respiran... veneno de serpiente... por el camino del viento... voy soplando agua ardiente

El día a día ha comenzado entusiasmado y alegre

Dice... Pasaporte

Tengo tu antídoto... Pal' que no tiene identidad
Somos idénticos... Pal' que llegó sin avisar
Tengo tu antílico... Para los que ya no est'n para los que est's y los que vienen [x2]

Un nómada sin rumbo la energía negativa yo la derrumbo
Con mis pezuñas de cordero me propuse recorrer el continente entero
Sin brújula, sin tiempo, sin agenda...
Inspirao Por las leyendas
Con historias empaquetadas en lata, con los cuentos que la lunarelata aprendí a caminar sin mapa...
A irme de caminata sin comodidades, sin lujo... protegido por los santos y los brujos...
Aprendí a escribir carbonerías en mi libreta y con un mismo idioma sacudir todo el planeta...
Aprendí que mi pueblo todavía reza porque las """"fucking"""" autoridades y la puta realeza... todavía se mueven por debajo' e la mesa... aprendí a tragarme la depresión con cerveza...
Mis patronos yo lo escupo desde las montañas y con mi propia saliva enveneno su champaña...
Enveneno su champaña...

Sigo tomando ron...

Rn tu sonrisa yo veo una guerrilla, una aventura un movimiento...
Tu lenguaje, tu acento... Yo quiero descubrir lo que ya estaba descubierto...
Ser un emigrante ese es mi deporte...
Hoy me voy pal' norte sin pasaporte, sin transporte... a pie, con las patas... pero no importa este hombre se hidrata con lo que retratan mis pupilas...
Cargo con un par de paisajes en mi mochila, cargo con vitamina de clorofila, cargo con un rosario que me vigila... suelo con cruzar elmeridiano, resbalando por las cuerdas del cuatro de Aureliano...
Y llegarle tempranito temprano a la orilla... por el desierto con los pies a la parrilla...
Por debajo de la tierra como las ardillas, yo vo'a cruzar la muralla... yo soy un intruso con identidad de recluso... y por eso me convierto en buzo... y buceo por debajo de la tierra...
Pa' que no me vean los guardias y los perros no me huelan... abuela no se preocupe que en mi cuello cuelga la virgen de la Guadalupe...

Oye para todos los emigrantes del mundo entero... all' va eso... Calle 13

LYRICS

So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying, I don't know
the aberration of this world
I tried to deal with
It killed a part of me that was raging
The pain is gone, the denial
I ran away from institutions
I owe my self life
There's no way I will respond to this passion 
Anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
The desire that you once had to reveal yourself
Forget to create your own life

Anger
Lies
Denial

The righteous anger boiling inside us
Won't last forever
Don't fear to let is out
Branches have grown through

Esta canción, que se ha traducido a multitud de idiomas, ha llegado a popularizarse tanto que en muchos sitios se considera autóctona. Fue compuesta en plena dictadura del General Franco en España y es un llamamiento a la unidad de acción para liberase de las ataduras, para conseguir la libertad. Se ha convertido en un símbolo de la lucha por la libertad.

L'avi Siset em parlava de bon matí al portal
mentre el sol esperàvem i els carros vèiem passar.
Siset, que no veus l'estaca on estem tots lligats?
Si no podem desfer-nos-en mai no podrem caminar!

Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar.
Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, ben corcada deu ser ja.
Si jo l'estiro fort per aquí i tu l'estires fort per allà,
segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, i ens podrem alliberar.

Però, Siset, fa molt temps ja, les mans se'm van escorxant,
i quan la força se me'n va ella és més ampla i més gran.
Ben cert sé que està podrida però és que, Siset, pesa tant,
que a cops la força m'oblida. Torna'm a dir el teu cant:

Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar.
Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, ben corcada deu ser ja.
Si jo l'estiro fort per aquí i tu l'estires fort per allà,
segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, i ens podrem alliberar.

L'avi Siset ja no diu res, mal vent que se l'emporta,
ell qui sap cap a quin indret i jo a sota el portal.
I mentre passen els nous vailets estiro el coll per cantar
el darrer cant d'en Siset, el darrer que em va ensenyar.

Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar.

Lyrics: 

So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I cc'ed every girl that I'd see, see 'round town

And hate to see y'all frown, but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back?

Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night, stole the light from the sun
Would not burn me on my bum when I shoot the moon",8521,326,0,1,182904,2009-10-25 21:09:31,1,"Rap, One Day, UGKVEVO, stripped, official, Pocket Full Of Stones, hq, cover, full album, karaoke, download, piano, music, Murda, Best of UGK, audio, lyrics, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Diamonds And Wood, High Life, UGK (Underground Kingz) feat.

PAROLES:
L'amour

On te dit ta route est tracée d’avance alors tu gardes ce que tu penses pour toi
Pile ou face c’est sans importance, laisse décider la chance, cesse de demander pourquoi
Alors on peut dessiner des mots d’amour du bout des lèvres
On peut siffler comme un oiseau quand le soleil se lève
On peut laisser ces mots crever dans sa bouche et rentrer seul quand le soleil se couche

Ah ha, dis moi qu’on est deux ma belle et qu’il y a ta voix qui m’appelle
Et dis moi qu’est-ce qu’on va faire?
On fait l’amour, on fait la guerre

On te dit que tout est noir et tout est blanc
Qu’on est pour ou qu’on est contre et qu’il faudra choisir un camps
Ah non, allons voir s’il nous est permis de garder l’espoir
On peut dire à celle qu’on aime qu’on l’aime et qu’elle est belle
Recommencer tous les matin quand le soleil se lève
On peut viser tous les cœurs et ne jamais faire mouche
Et pleurer comme un bébé quand le soleil se couche

Ah ha, dis moi qu’on est deux ma belle et qu’il y a ta voix qui m’appelle
Et dis moi qu’est-ce qu’on va faire?
On fait l’amour, on fait la guerre
Ah ha, dis moi qu’on est deux ma belle et qu’il y a ta voix qui m’appelle
Et dis moi qu’est-ce qu’on va faire?
On fait l’amour, on fait la guerre

On veut coller nos deux corps
Et déposer les armes
Dépasser la mort et monter encore
Jusqu’aux cimes des arbres

Ah ha, dis moi qu’on est deux ma belle et qu’il y a ta voix qui m’appelle
Et dis moi qu’est-ce qu’on va faire?
On fait l’amour, on fait la guerre
Ah ha, dis moi qu’on est deux ma belle et qu’il y a ta voix qui m’appelle
Et dis moi qu’est-ce qu’on va faire?

Boney M. is a truly unforgettable name in the history of music. This glamorous and extremely likeable group came together in 1976 and ever since then occupied a special place in the hearts of music lovers the world over. Frank Farian, Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, Bobby Farrell (and Reggie Tsiboe from 1982 to 1990) formed Boney M.
Though Boney M. made modest beginnings, they soon turned into a major hit with their music which was catchy, lively and very rhythmic. Boney M's music has influences of Reggae, Funk, Rock, Gospel and Disco.
Their songs had distinctive soul soothing melodies and foot tapping beats and this is probably the reason why Boney M's songs were played non stop at all the discos around the world.
Boney M. - the most successful pop music export in the history of Germany. To date, worldwide sold 160 million copies of their albums and singles.

Gangnam Style - Hyuna Ver. was discussed during the making of the music video for ""Gangnam Style."" It can be perceived as the girl version for ""Gangnam Style."" The main female for this music video is 4minute's Hyuna. ""Gangnam Style"" is reborn with 'Oppa Is Just My Style' by Hyuna!

'강남스타일' 뮤직비디오 제작 당시 함께 기획됐던 '오빤 딱 내 스타일'은 여성의 관점에서 '강남스타일'을 재해석한 것으로 걸그룹 포미닛의 현아가 주인공으로 출연한 사실이 알려져 화제를 모은 바 있다. 싸이는 '오빤 딱 내 스타일' 뮤직비디오 공개로 전세계인들과 다시 한 번 즐겁게 이번 '강남 스타일'의 열기를 이어나갈 계획이다!

Lyrics:

When I'm up at seven, the sunrise gives me a glimpse of heaven 
I get right to work, a farmer's life can be a little berserk yeah
This is how I roll, I feed the cattle till their stomachs are full
Treat em right, that's my belief, 
What's for dinner? I say beef!

Gotta Feed Everybody
Gotta Feed Everybody
Gotta Feed Everybody 
(Uh-Huh) I work out (side!)

When I step to the bunk (yeah)
This is what I see (Uh-huh)
All the hungry cattle are staring at me
  
I got passion for my plants and I ain't afraid to show it show it show it show it
I'm farming and I grow it

When I'm in my tractor, I got more power than an arc reactor
And when I'm in the field, I try to raise crops to maximum yield
This is how I roll, without me the world would be outta control
The hours I work, there is no equal
Gotta feed the mouths of hungry people 
 
Gotta Feed Everybody
Gotta Feed Everybody
Gotta Feed Everybody 
(Uh-Huh) I work out (side!)

When I step to the bunk (yeah)
This is what I see (Uh-huh)
All the hungry cattle are staring at me

I got passion for my plants and I ain't afraid to show it show it show it show it

Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the beloved ""Peanuts"" gang are dancing way to the big-screen, with moves like you've never been seen before, in state of the art 3D animation. 

Snoopy, the world's most lovable beagle - and flying ace - embarks upon his greatest mission as he takes to the skies to pursue his arch-nemesis The Red Baron, while his best pal, Charlie Brown, begins his own epic quest. From the imagination of Charles M. Schulz and the creators of the ICE AGE films, THE PEANUTS MOVIE will prove that every underdog has his day.

歌詞

「雨の匂いに懐かしくなるのは何でなんでしょうか。
夏が近づくと胸が騒めくのは何でなんでしょうか。
人に笑われたら涙が出るのは何でなんでしょうか。
それでもいつか報われるからと思えばいいんでしょうか。」

さよならって言葉でこんなに胸を裂いて
今もたった数瞬の夕焼けに足が止まっていた

「先生、人生相談です。
この先どうなら楽ですか。
そんなの誰もわかりはしないよなんて言われますか。
ほら、苦しさなんて欲しいわけない。
何もしないで生きていたい。
青空だけが見たいのは我儘ですか。」


「胸が痛んでも嘘がつけるのは何でなんでしょうか。
悪い人ばかりが得をしてるのは何でなんでしょうか。
幸せの文字が￥を含むのは何でなんでしょうか。
一つ線を抜けば辛さになるのはわざとなんでしょうか。」

青春って値札が背中に貼られていて
ヒッチコックみたいなサスペンスをどこか期待していた

「先生、どうでもいいんですよ。
生きてるだけで痛いんですよ。
ニーチェもフロイトもこの穴の埋め方は書かないんだ。

ただ夏の匂いに目を瞑って、
雲の高さを指で描こう。
想い出だけが見たいのは我儘ですか。」　　


「ドラマチックに人が死ぬストーリーって売れるじゃないですか。
花の散り際にすら値が付くのも嫌になりました。

先生の夢は何だったんですか。
大人になると忘れちゃうものなんですか。」


「先生、人生相談です。
この先どうなら楽ですか。
涙が人を強くするなんて全部詭弁でした。

あぁ、この先どうでもいいわけなくて、現実だけがちらついて、
夏が遠くて。

これでも本当にいいんですか。
このまま生きてもいいんですか。
そんなの君にしかわからないよなんて言われますか。

ただ夏の匂いに目を瞑りたい。
いつまでも風に吹かれたい。
青空だけが見たいのは我儘ですか。」

あなただけを知りたいのは我儘ですか",944,229,0,1,110960,2018-04-11 09:00:04,0,,ヨルシカ - ヒッチコック (MUSIC VIDEO),t7MBzMP4OzY,9036454,CMgBEAA,n,0,18,4,11,101,2,6.955998042162192,3.588047496986083,5.0451664480652285,2.974971994298069,6,15,0.0,29,0.0,0,0.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0.7252972783323263,0.5158206594133513,1.6958702326391522,0,0,0.0

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
and maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
But right now..

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains..

You're gone..
You're gone..
Baby you're gone

After spending the past couple of months travelling to Afghanistan to perform for our troops, touring through Canada, L.A and Las Vegas and catching up with old friends, today we are very excited to present the video for our track ""My Life' featuring Ceekay Jones.

In addition to some big moments from our recent trip, (including Eso's wedding in Las Vegas!) this video centers around our friend and Australian FMX athlete Cam (sincs) Sinclair's near-fatal crash at the 2009 Red Bull X Fighters Freestyle Motocross event in Madrid, then his incredible comeback at the 2010 X Games in Los Angeles. My Life also features some of our mates inspirational stories including Robbie Maddison, TJ Lavin, Aaron ""Wheelz"" Fotheringham, Jaie Toohey, Cam White, James Doerfling and a bunch of other world class athletes.

""O Helga Natt"" en julpsalm och en sång om Kristus. Att välja ut bilder har därför inte varit så lätt. Jag har försökt att få en balans mellan julbilder och bilder med religiös anknytning, som tex kyrkor. Hoppas ni tycker om resultatet. Lämna gärna en kommentar, men tänk på att hålla ett vårdat språk eftersom kommentaren annars tas bort och medför blockering.

""O Helga Natt"" är f.ö. det sista spåret på den makalösa CD:n ""Till Havs"" som kom ut för ett par år sedan. Skivan innehåller Jussis sista insjungningar på svenska och är ett absolut måste i varje svensk skivsamling. Så om du fortfarande har någon som du inte har köpt en julklapp till så har du nu den perfekta presenten. 

Ber även om ursäkt för de negativa kommentarer folk (ateister) lämnar. Tar bort dessa när jag hinner. Ha nu en underbar jul 2011 och väl mött sedan i 2012 - ett år som kommer bli superbt för oss alla. Jag lovar. Och, höll så när på att glömma, gå till kyrkan nu under julhelgen, för då mår ni så himla mycket bättre. Inget slår nämligen att få sjunga med i julpsalmerna på plats i kyrkan.

""Geçti O Günler"" şarkı sözleri ile

Geçti o günler acıttı geçti
Sonunu boş ver başı güzeldi
Uzun bir yoldu haliyle yordu
Pişmanlığım yok bize değerdi

Varsa ki suçlu bence gururdu
Şikâyetim yok bize değerdi

Gönüllü olduk sevmedik zorla
Öğrendik aşkı kırıla kırıla
Hazin bir sonduk gün ortasında 
Sen unutsan da unutmam asla

Aklımıza gelir miydi böyle bir elveda
Söyleseler gülerdik. Ağladık ama.

nosso propósito de mostrar a você a unção recebida nesse local pode ser percebida.
This clip started normally, But in the midst of the recording, it eventually became a watching. Hence, even though you may find continuity errors, our purpose to show you the anointing received at this location can be perceived.

MUNDO DE ILUSÕES

Ei, por que tá me ligando em plena madrugada
Se entre nós dois não existe mais nada
Quer fazer com ele o que fez comigo

Ei, será que você não consegue ser fiel
Tá falando comigo dentro de um motel
Enganando ele como me enganou

Não vai ser dessa vez
Que vai fazer com ele o que você me fez
Por favor me escute logo de uma vez
Seu amor é um mundo de ilusões
Brincando com dois corações

Será que dentro do seu peito não tem coração
E a sua cabeça, só pensa em traição
Sai pra lá com esse seu amor bandido
E me traiu com ele e quer trair ele comigo

Uoh uoh você não sabe dar valor
Uoh uoh agora perdeu o meu amor
Uoh uoh e vai perder ele também
Não deu certo comigo e não da certo com ninguém
Uoh uoh uoh uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh agora perdeu meu amor
Uoh uoh e vai perder ele também
Não deu certo comigo e não da certo com ninguém

We live in a world where we are sometimes prone to judgement. Perception becomes our reality. In our haste, we can jump to false conclusions and opportunities to lift and lighten the loads of others are lost. As we allow the light of Christ to work miracles within our own heart, we then are empowered to work wonders in the lives of others. May His perfect example of love and compassion for all guide us in our own charity towards those around us this Christmas season and always. Please help us #LIGHTtheWORLD by tagging and sharing this video with those you love. 

A special thanks to the YWCA of Salt Lake City and our wonderful fans and fellow actors who helped us portray this message of hope and healing.

LYRICS
O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and e'er pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices.
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine.

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices.
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine.

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine.

About the Lyrics

The lyrics tell the story of a man who looks up and whistles while he is walking so that his tears won't fall. The verses of the song describe his memories and feelings. The English-language lyrics of the version recorded by A Taste of Honey are not a translation of the original Japanese lyrics but a completely different set of lyrics set to the same basic melody.

The title Sukiyaki, a Japanese hot pot dish, has nothing to do with the lyrics or the meaning of the song; the word served the purpose only because it was short, catchy, recognizably Japanese, and more familiar to most English speakers. A Newsweek columnist noted that the re-titling was like issuing ""Moon River"" in Japan under the title ""Beef Stew.""

About the song:

""Ue o Muite Arukō"" (上を向いて歩こう?, literally ""[I] shall walk looking up"") is a Japanese-language song that was performed by Japanese crooner Kyu Sakamoto, and written by lyricist Rokusuke Ei and composer Hachidai Nakamura. It is best known under the alternative title ""Sukiyaki"" in English-speaking parts of the world. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the United States in 1963, and was the only Japanese-language song to do so. In total it sold over 13 million copies internationally. The original Kyu Sakamoto recording also went to number eighteen on the R&B chart.[3] In addition, the single spent five weeks at number one on the Middle of the Road charts. The recording was originally released in Japan by Toshiba in 1961. It topped the Popular Music Selling Record chart in the Japanese magazine Music Life for three months, and was ranked as the number one song of 1961 in Japan.
Well-known English-language cover versions include a 1981 cover under the title ""Sukiyaki"" by A Taste of Honey and a 1995 cover by 4 P.M.. There is also an English language version with altogether different lyrics by Jewel Akens under the title ""My First Lonely Night"" recorded in 1966. There are many other language versions of the song as well.

About Kyu Sakamoto:

Kyu Sakamoto (坂本 九 Sakamoto Kyū?, born Hisashi Oshima (大島 九 Ōshima Hisashi?), 10 December 1941 -- 12 August 1985) was a Japanese singer and actor, best known outside of Japan for his international hit song ""Sukiyaki"", which was sung in Japanese and sold over 13 million copies. It reached number one in the United States Billboard Hot 100 in June 1963.

Tá me achando com cara de bobo?
Por que tá me ligando de novo?
Dessa vez eu só tô te atendendo pra dizer
Que ontem foi a nossa última vez

Você deve se achar muito esperta
Toda vez com a mesma conversa
Me ilude, me joga no chão
E quando vou dormir já estou com você na sua cama

Eu não consigo entender você
Sempre me diz que é amor, mas só me quer por prazer
Olha pra trás, veja tudo o que fez
Agora quer ficar comigo e não vai ter outra vez

Tô cansando de sair no meio da noite e te satisfazer
E um minuto depois de matar minha vontade eu me arrepender
Sair de madrugada, do meio da balada
Largo a minha vida pra viver você
Só pra viver você

Você sabe que eu sou louco por você e que me tem nas mãos
E confesso que as vezes me pego esperando a sua ligação
Estava fora de mim esquece o que eu falei

""Se o mundo acabar em 2012...""

Mais uma vez, mais uma profecia, e mais um ponto final tentando achar seu lugar na história do mundo. Depois de tantos anos de sonhos, de tanta luta, quando finalmente estamos chegando a algum lugar, finalmente estamos começando a subir essa escada da vida, vem alguém dizendo que o mundo vai acabar, bem quando a gente achava que estava só começando. 

Passos, risadas, lágrimas e muito, muito suor foi derramado até aqui, e essa nova música, chamada ""Se o Mundo Acabar"" vem celebrar, engrandecer esses feitos, que talvez sejam pequenos aos olhos do mundo, mais são o começo de uma vida nova nos nossos caminhos.

Com uma base de tom emocionante produzida por DJ Caique, um flow diferente dos que estamos acostumados a ouvir na voz de Rashid, e uma mensagem praticamente de agradecimento... Aos fãs, a vida, a Deus. Podemos sintetizar assim o sentimento dessa faixa, que conta desde o primeiro passo da carreira até o giro pelo país, de show em show, que vem acontecendo principalmente em 2011.

Música feita pra ser ouvida à meia noite do dia 31 de dezembro, ou nos momentos de ""virada"" de nossas vidas... Essa é a intenção. 

E por isso, de coração aberto, oferecemos essa música a todos aqueles que foram em nossos shows, que fizeram barulho, que baixaram as músicas, compraram os CDS e camisetas, e que acreditam em nosso trabalho! A todos aqueles que dividem o mesmo amor pelo Rap, pela arte, pelas ruas, e realmente acreditam que nossa palavra cause efeito nos corações e isso pode ser o começo da mudança do mundo. Essa música é de vocês!

""O mundo pode até acabar em 2012, mas o importante é que minha vida mudou, que eu vivi um sonho, e ainda tive a honra de mudar algumas vidas... ""

- Biografia Luis Bordon:
Desde a infância recebeu incentivo de seus pais para se dedicar à música. Começou a estudar a harpa paraguaia e logo se tornou exímio nesse instrumento. Em 1950, entrou para a orquestra de Julián Rejala que fez várias apresentações no Paraguai e no Brasil. Em 1959, gravou seu primeiro LP, Harpa Paraguaya en Hi-Fi. Mudou-se para o Brasil, onde ficou vários anos e, em 1970, gravou o disco que o tornaria conhecido nesse país, A Harpa e a Cristandade, com canções de Natal tais como Jingle Bells e Noite Feliz e que foi durante vários anos um grande sucesso de vendas nas festas natalinas e reveillon. Mudou-se para os EUA onde morou três anos antes de voltar ao Paraguai, onde morreu em 2006 aos 80 anos. Gravou um total de 34 discos.",5,157,0,0,148,2011-11-27 17:14:51,0,"Música, natalina, clima, de, natal, festa, fim, ano, luis, bordon, harpa, paraguaia, solos, méximo, polca, cristandade, 1970",▶ O Velhinho - Luis Bordon - A Harpa e a Cristandade,9QRMvlpA3cU,44277,CN4CEAA,o,0,11,11,27,331,6,4.646178187464514,1.0,2.170261715394957,0.6989700043360189,4,47,0.0,147,0.0,16,0.0,11,0,5,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,3,3,1,0,3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,52,0.4671068624208966,0.2152306604809133,3.1049425610997154,1,0,0.0

Edoardo Vianello (Rome 1938) started with the music when as a kid he played the phisarmonica that his father gave to his sister and he started to create music.  He eventually learned the guitar and other instruments, participated in various competitions including the Festivals of Sanremo.

{Intro: Puff Daddy}

Yeah... this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

{Verse One: Puff Daddy}

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death

{Chorus: Faith Evans}

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

{Puff} I miss you Big

{Verse Two: Puff Daddy}

It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in heaven smilin down (eheh)
Watchin us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I coul turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death

{Faith Evans} Somebody tell me why

{Interlude: Faith Evans}

One glad morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

{Outro: 112}

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
{Puff} Every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
{Puff} Is a day that I get closer
{Puff} To seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
{Puff} We miss you Big... and we won't stop
Every move I make, every single day
{Puff} Cause we can't stop... that's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day

Act a fool you better watch out (Uh-huh)
Hot shit be ringin the cops out (Come On)
Street niggas is ringin them shots out
Short circuits blacken the blocks out
Now open up the garage and pull the drops out
Rockin the fur coat bringin the blue fox out
Diamonds light up the block runnin the blue rocks out (Uh)
Wylin till all of my crew knocked out (Come On)
Get yo' ass up on the floor (Huh!)
Throw ya hands if you wan't some more (Ho!!!)
Baby, we'll leave your crotch out
And peep the way we be blowin them spots out
Come on, look how we got 'em ready to act out
Girl, I'm ready to give it twistin your back out (Let's go)
Drink yack till a nigga fallin out
Flat on his back now watch a nigga crawlin out, talk to me

ยากเพียงใดที่จะไม่รัก ยากยิ่งกว่านั้นถ้าจะไม่แคร์
เมื่อเราเองต่างมีข้อแม้ และมีเงื่อนไขที่ใจต้องยอมรับมัน
ต่อให้รักมากมายเท่าไร คงต้องยิ่งไกลจากเธอเท่านั้น

*อยากอยู่ใกล้เธอสักแค่ไหน ก็คงต้องห่างไว้
ก็เพราะไม่อยากหวั่นไหวไปมากกว่านี้
ให้เรามีระยะห่างไว้ เมื่อทำได้เท่านี้
เก็บความรู้สึกที่แสนดี ให้มันอยู่ในใจ

เมื่อใจเราต่างคนต่างรู้ ว่าไม่อาจยืนคู่กันและกัน
หนึ่งก้าวที่เธอห่างจากฉัน ไม่ทำให้รักของเรามันจางหายไป
แต่ว่ารักมากมายเท่าไร คงต้องยิ่งไกลจากเธอเท่านั้น

Carla's Dreams - Lacrimi si Pumni in Pereti | VERSURI

Inima ei în mâna ta, spune ea
Te minte ca tu să ai grijă de ea,
Dar îngerul tău e un demon cu harpă de fapt
Și el vrea, vrea,
Să atingă corzi în patul tău și pe muzica ta
Ea spune, spune, spune că nu vrea să lovești
Cu pumnii în pereți
Tu știi că minte și ar vrea și lacrimi

Lacrimi și pumni în pereți, lacrimi și pumni, pumni în pereți
Tu spune-i
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Cea mai tristă frază este “totul va fi bine”
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
De la atâția băieți beți pentru fete ca tine.

Cu ochii de sticlă, cu haine negre în portbagaj
E testul suprem, e un ultim mesaj, ultim mesaj,
E un dans violent, tu înveți altfel de pași
Ea aruncă în tine cu argumente
Tu taci și urci etaj cu etaj
Ea spune, spune, spune că nu vrea să lovești
Cu pumni în pereți
Tu știi că minte și ar vrea și lacrimi
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți, lacrimi și pumni, pumni în pereți
Tu spune-i

Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Cea mai tristă frază este “totul va fi bine”
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
De la atâția băieți beți pentru fete ca tine.

Tu minte-o că nu o să mai doară
Și spune-i că e frumoasă
Și-n visele tale adesea
Tu o cereai de mireasă
Dar azi se va rupe în patru
Sufletul tău, tu spune-i,
Încă o dată “iubire”, încă o dată pe nume
Tu spune-i

Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Lacrimi și pumni în pereți
Cea mai tristă frază este “totul va fi bine”

In Libyen tobt gerade der Krieg. Die rechte Politik in Europa nimmt an Schwung auf, besetzt die Geheimdienste und Innenministerien. Währenddessen sterben immer mehr Menschen im Mittelmeer. Der Pass ist nicht nur ein Unterdrückungsinstrument nach Innen, es ist auf das zentrale Symbol für Ausgrenzung und Tod an unseren Europäischen Außengrenzen.

Wir waren in Libyen und haben Menschen nach ihrer Lebensrealität gefragt. Wir haben uns entschieden, mit Künstler*innen zu kooperieren, die bereit sind, sich mit anderen Europäer*innen zu morphen und ihren Pass zu teilen. Es ist ein Spiel der Identitäten, es ist aber auch ein letzter verzweifelter Versuch, nicht mehr tatenlos zuzusehen. Wir schicken Ihnen europäische Pässe, in denen sie zur Hälfte selbst erkennbar somd und hoffen, dass sie damit in Europa einreisen können.

Lyrics:

Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the deal, yo?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won'tyou come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and

""Cool Kids"" Lyrics:

She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style
They all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible and she's just in the background

And she says

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane, living life without knowing

And he says

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

And they said

I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
I wish that I could be like the cool kids cuz all the cool kids, they seem to fit in

Este video de ""Casi que me pierdo"" es el primer corte del disco ""El paso gigante"", editado en 2011 y producido por Jim Fox, una leyenda de extensa trayectoria con grandes artistas del reggae como Don Carlos, Gregory Issacs, Black Uhuru e Israel Vibration entre otros.

Narration
비가 내리던 여름밤 어떤 꼬마의 이야기
나조차 돌보지 않았던 나의 옛날 얘기

Verse 1

어둡고 좁은 방은 극도로 불안해
두꺼운 구름은 이내 비를 퍼붓고
난 이마와 가슴팍에 성호를 긋고
어린 시절을 떠올려 비오면 듣곤 하던
낡은 라디오 맑은 날이 오길
정말 지겨운 장마 끝날 그 날이 오기를
하늘에 가까운 우리 집 바깥에 천둥소리만 가득해
눈물을 닦아주던 엄마는 없고 아빠도 안 계셔
난 이불을 덮고 한숨을 낮게 쉬었고
이런 날은 내 그림자마저 날 괴롭혀
몰래 손을 뻗어 라디오 볼륨을 높여
빗소리보다 노랫소리 커질 때
빗방울보다 눈물이 짙어질 때
꼬만 잠든다 조그만 창문 밖
빗소리 숨어있는 꼬말 찾는다

Verse 2

비가 그친 하늘에는 어느덧 곱게
별이 피어나네 국자모양 일곱 개
내가 붙인 이름은 검둥이 진돗개
행복이 뭔지 몰라도 난 행복해
겁 많던 아이 세상은 울타리가 되주진 않더라
나이 어린 꼬마의 두눈에
세상이 잿빛으로 머무네
질문이 질문에 꼬리를 끝없이 무네
TV속에 사람들은 웃고만 있는데
엄마랑 아빠는 왜 울고만 있는데

책에 나온 행복이란 도대체 뭔지
아빠의 편지 그리고 눈가에 번지는 슬픔
미안하단 얘기만 있을뿐
슬픈 얘기도 없는데 왜 자꾸 슬픈지
비오는 밤이면 난 덩치만 큰 꼬마
몸뚱이만 늙고만 아홉살짜리 꼬마

Verse 3

(떠올리는 것들을 모아서 시를 썼어)
아주 가끔 날 괴롭히는 건
다 끝난 일들에 사로잡히는 것
접고 있던 기억들을 현실과 맞바꾼 담부터는
자꾸만 마이크만 손에 잡히는 걸
나 어느새 짙은 검은색
마이클 쥐고 서있네 과거의 어둔색
헤치고 나와 무대로 올라
모두가 놀랄 라임을 쏟아내지
어릴때는 몰랐던 운명
꼬마가 울면 따라 노래부르던 라디오는 분명
훨씬 더 시간이 지나 거친 도시
위를 거침없이 걷는 것이
바로 꼬마의 길임을 알고 있었네
나는 감춰온 비밀을 꺼내 시를 썼네
어렵던 슬픔과 허덕였던 시간들을 노래로 썼네

Letra:
 
No começo, eu entendia
Mas era só cama, não tinha amor 
Lembro quando você dizia 
“Vou desligar por que ela chegou”

E a gente foi se envolvendo 
Perdendo o medo 
não tinha lugar e nem hora 
Pra dar um beijo 
Coração não tá mais aceitando  
Só metade do seu te amo 

é uma ciumeira 
Atrás da outra 
Ter que dividir seu corpo 
E a sua boca 
Tá bom que eu aceitei por um instante 
A verdade é que amante não quer ser 
AMANTE

Reik- Ya me enteré 

Ya me enteré que hay alguien nuevo acariciando tu piel 
Algún idiota al que quieres convencer 
Que tú y yo somos pasado

Ya me enteré que soy el malo y todo el mundo te cree
Que estás mejor desde que ya no me ves
 Más feliz con otro a lado 
A quién piensas que vas a engañar 
Sabes bien que eres mi otra mitad

Olvídate es un perdedor y repítele que yo soy mejor 
Que no le eres fiel con el corazónque eres mía y solo mía 
Amor despídete es un perdedor que imagina que ya no existo yo 
Deja claro que aunque intente no, no vas a querer 
La verdad es que me extrañas tanto lo sé  
Ya me enteré 

Regresarás estoy seguro de que regresarás 
Estás con él por pura comodidad 
Aburrida entre sus brazos 
A quién piensas que vas a engañar, sabes bien que eres mi otra mitad 

Olvídate es un perdedor y repítele que yo soy mejor 
Que no le eres fiel con el corazón que eres mía y solo mía 
Amor despídete es un perdedor que imagina que ya no existo yo 
Deja claro que aunque intente no, no vas a querer no
La verdad es que me extrañas tanto lo sé 
Ya me enteré

Lyrics:
Me llamas... Para decirme que te marchas,
Que ya no aguantas mas,
Que ya estas harta.....
De verle cada dia,
De compartir su cama
De domingos de futbol, metida en casa

Me dices que el amor, igual que llega pasa
Y el tuyo se marcho por la ventana
Y que encontró un lugar, en otra cama

Y te has pintado la sonrisa de carmin,
Y te has colgado el bolso que te regalo
Y aquel vestido que nunca estrenaste
Lo estrenas hoy
Y sales a la calle.....buscando amor
(bis)

Me llamas para decirte que te engaña
Que ya de vuestro amor, no queda nada
Que se busco otro nido
Que abandono tu casa
Que te faltan caricias... Por las mañanas

Me dices que el amor, igual que llega pasa
Y el tuyo se marcho por la ventana
Y que encontró un lugar, en otra cama

Y te has pintado la sonrisa de carmin,
Y te has colgado el bolso que te regalo
Y aquel vestido que nunca estrenaste

Perdóname Dios mío por que yo he pecado 
To' este dinero me tiene enamorado 
La fama y el poder a mi me secuestraron
Pero yo no me voy a morir
Y ahora estamo aquí, seguimos aquí 
Yo soy intocable como Pablo en Medellin 
Yo nunca voy a matar a un hermano como Caín 
Yo tengo 1,000 soldados como Osama y Hussein

Mis hermanos se mueren por mi y yo me muero por ellos también 
Los kilos en los faldos, los faldos en los botes y por faldo los kilos son 100
yo soy una estrella alzo mis cadenas como si estuviera en Belén 
y yo tengo una cruz en el bicho y tengo a tu puta gritándome amén

El diablo rojo, rorrueco 
La F N rompe chaleco 
La droga toa pa’ los teco
Y tu te vas a morir como checo 

200,000 en el cuello 
Los kilo de droga y los sellos 
te mandamos en el expreso 
y el talibán se cae del camello 

El Draco pinta’o Louis Vuitton 
la 9 “full” con el Botón 
De enfriamiento el sistemón 
y de peines 30 yo tengo un vagón 
La glope de la 4ta generación
le compre el de 50 al Teton 
en el casco te pongo 1,000,000 
y los gatos to’ van a casar al ratón 

Me compre el Panamera 
Acosta’o en mi celda desde la nevera
Y los cabrones que a mi me arrestaron 
Pensaron que me jodieron mi carrera

Pero les hice 1,000,000 tando preso 
Y yo soy intocable adentro y afuera
Y mi puta esta hecha completa 
Y tienen el culo como Natalia Rivera

Te la traficamos como si fuera el veneno

Rafagazo pa’ sentir
donde estoy Yo ningúno puede competir 
Pablo y el Chapo, de palo “refill”
una falla y te mandamos con los difuntos a dormir 

A tu gata le metemos 
La cuenta no tiene freno 
por los enemigos brindemos 
La vía es directa y no nos caemos

Patek, ap tourbillon 
Cotiza esta combi ya vale 1,000,000

original song 

And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather
And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love, she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, thats her campaign
We fight, we love

Chorus: Raphael Saadiq
We fight and love so much sometimes
I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat and
It will find out who we are
[2x]

[Verse 2]
And it, and it begins, he's off the ball
He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place, that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
They say salaam, they cary bombs
In crouded places, and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, its cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin for your soul, and WMD's
You can't find nothing, cause its empty
You got your gun, and he's your friend
And he's your man, until the end
We fight, we love

0,Creedence Clearwater Revival,104,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Creedence Clearwater Revival is undeniably one of the greatest rock bands of all time, with an instantly recognizable, raw, bayou sound, popularized in songs like ""Proud Mary"" and ""Green River”. Since their formation in the 1960s, CCR has sold over 50 million records, while their songs remain in heavy rotation on the radio. 

Though the band only released 7 studio albums in their too-short career,  Creedence had an astonishing track record: eight consecutive gold singles (""Proud Mary,"" ""Bad Moon Rising,"" ""Green River,"" ""Down on the Corner,"" ""Who'll Stop the Rain,"" ""Up Around the Bend,"" ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain?"") and eight consecutive gold albums. With music that sounds as fresh and compelling today as it did 30 years ago, CCR is one of a handful of bands whose entire body of work has attained true ""classic"" status.

Collagically Speaking is a raw document that seamlessly adheres neo-soul to future-funk, West Coast jazz of the moment to astral electronica, instrumental hip-hop to musique concrète, avant-garde to classical—these are single-take songs, written live in the room, that go wherever this formidable crew's mood goes. The themes that bind it all together are both spoken and inferred: romantic love, universal love, systemic bigotry, the women's movement, quiet power, wild creativity, personal loss and growth.

在沒有你以後Feat.張智成
『要你知道用情歌Battle也可以是一件很屌的事』
謝和弦與大馬R&B王子張智成首度合唱作品「在沒有你以後」，回想起剛上台北簽進唱片公司當練習生的那段時間，謝和弦靠著師兄張智成帶著他在台北走跳，照顧他這個從埔里北上的庄腳囝仔，這是他們相識的最初，至今已累積了十多年的情誼。兩個相互在歌裡各自訴說著沒有你以後的一個人世界，像是兩條線的故事，卻有著相同的心情，這是謝和弦vs.張智成在抒情歌裡Battle的本事，彷彿也為彼此空洞的心填補了溫度。

阿扣：什麼時候開始 一個人 習慣一個人 算不算天份
怎麼學會抽完菸一根  接著再一根 算不算 看透了

智成：不想要承認 也不想默認 我只想麻痺著什麼 
不需要過問 也不必再問 就讓時間捫心自問

阿扣：有多久 後座沒人坐 沒人抱著我
沒有撒嬌電話 沒有深情的吻 
沒人整理的房間像闖空門  

智成：有多久 後來沒有我 沒有再牽手
沒有再為了爭吵 誰先認錯

Lyrics:

Seven o'clock in the morning 
And the rays from the sun wakes me 
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me 
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom 
Then she comes out and kisses me 
And to my surprise, she ain't you 

Now I've got this dumb look on my face 
Like, what have I done? 
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?

Lyrics:

You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it
And something like my bank account
I wanna spend it, baby

It's something about your love that's got me going crazy
Baby, you know I want you real bad
And girl I really like your freaky style
How can I be down with you?
So get a little closer to my ride
I wanna get to know you lady
And hip me up on how to get inside you
Listen, pretty baby

I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it
Is all I wanna do for you baby
Girl, it's something kind of sexy

Lyrics:
I am a mountain
I am a tall tree ohh
I am a swift wind sweeping the country
I am a river down in the valley ohh
I am a vision and I can see clearly

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall 
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it 
Mmm..
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it 
Mmm..
I'm the world's greatest
the world greatest,
the world greatest, forever

I am a giant
I am an eagle ooh
I am a lion 
Down in the jungle
I am a marching band 
I am the people ooh
I am a helping hand
I am a hero

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that moutain peak up high
Hey, I made it
Mmmm...
I'm the world´s greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
Mmmm...
I'm the world´s greatest

In the ring of life, I'll reign love (I will reign)
And the world will notice a king (Oh Yeah..)
When there is darkness, I'll shine a light (Shine a light..)
And mirrors of success reflect in me
I'm that star up in the sky (uh, uh)
I'm that mountain (peak up high) peak up high
Hey I made It (hey I made it) 
I'm the worlds greatest (I'm that little bit)
I'm that little bit of hope (uh, uh)
When my back's against the ropes (oh yeah)
I can feel it (I can feel it)

I'm the world's greatest (repeat)

It's the greatest 
Can you feel it
It's the greatest


I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through
Hey, uh, hey, hey, hey, yeah
It's the greatest
I'm that star up in the sky

跟著他的嶄新搖滾態勢 找回我們心的態度
無畏青春的無偽愛情 新世代自衛愛情觀
已讀不回的愛 就快點讓開

///首波主打「愛不需要裝乖feat. Diana王詩安」///
只要傷的起 扛的住 誰都能在愛情裡何等偉大
由謝和弦與天王天后御用音樂人陳天佑共同寫詞，Skot Suyama陶山音樂人譜曲製作，用音樂解放我們對愛的態度，撞出新世代愛情裡最真實的溫度，找回心的角度去感受彼此重新體會。女孩也能擁有鋼鐵般的倔強，可愛也可壞；男孩也有細膩浪漫的瀟灑，會傷也會瘋得讓人心醉。一體兩面的感情觀，愛不是絕對的付出和委曲求全，『愛』不需要裝乖，因為誠實而在一起，因為誠實而分開，無需偽裝的愛才夠動人，無所畏懼地捍衛愛的真理，才是真實。

謝和弦與新世代女聲Diana王詩安首次合作，截然兩種不同的聲線，唱出愛情裡的拉扯與衝突。搖滾曲風裡，讓人驚豔的個性甜美，是這個世代女孩對愛情無所顧忌的敢愛敢恨，飆出了Diana王詩安歌聲裡的不羈靈魂；而謝和弦的硬漢式搖滾唱腔，在歌曲裡更顯得剛柔並濟，充滿暴烈畫面的搖滾情歌，重新顛覆對愛的定義，經歷毀滅崩塌後的新生愛情，是我們無畏現實捍衛真我的青春印記。

 이 날, 박원이 자신의 쇼케이스 무대에서 멋지게 선보인 후 기자간담회에 응하고 있다.

 모두가 좋아하는 단어 일수도 있고, 아니면 그냥 발음이 좋아서, 단순히 멋져 보여서 또는 의미가 내 모습 같아서, 우리 같아서, 그들의 모습 같아서 적어 놓고 모아 놓았던 단어들. 그 단어들의 대부분이 'r'로 시작됐고, 자연스럽게 곡의 가제로 붙여 놓고 작업하던 곡들이 익숙해져 앨범 타이틀을 'r'이다.

 박원의 이번 타이틀곡 '나'는 이전에 불렀던 곡들과는 조금 궤를 달리한다. 사랑이 아닌 박원의 치열한 철학적 고민이 담겨져 있다.

 또한, 전작인 [.OM]가 b-side 앨범이기에 그 다음은 정규 3집으로 생각하고 작업했지만, 6개 곡들이 하고 싶은 이야기를 담기에 모자르고 넘치지도 않는다고 생각되어 곡을 다듬는데 치중했다. 불편할 수 있는 이야기를 담아냈기에, 하지만 음악이라는 결과물은 결국 아름답게 들려줘야 한다는 생각에 그 어느 때보다 후반 작업에 많은 시도와 고민을 한 앨범이다.

 이번 앨범엔 항상 어딘가 착하고 상처받는 혹은 상처를 주었지만 슬퍼하고 미안하며 그 사람을 생각하는 주인공의 이야기는 없다. 내가 사랑의 주인공이 되어 사랑하는 사람에게 사랑을 속삭이는 노래도 없다. 하지만, 그 어느때보다 가장 슬픔앨범이 남겨진다.

Er was niemand die me kende zoals jij..
vanaf de eerste dag waren een feit..
en niemand die het wist van jouw en mij..
achteraf gezien was dat de leukste tijd..
maar de ruzies en verhalen kwamen vaker..
ik vroeg mezelluf af moet ik dit maar laten..
in me hoofd strokkelde ik met al die vragen..
omdat ik niet over gevoelens kon praten..
ik kan het nu nog niet geloven..
dat alles zo is afgelopen..
ik ben voor goed gestopt met hopen..
want alles wat we deelde is nu egt verloren..
tis niet alleen jouw schuld dat weet ik..
tzijn niet alleen jouw fouten die we niet vergeten..
maar tog heb ik me best gedaan..
en moeten wij ieder een kant op gaan..

ik ben niet meer van jouw, jij bent niet meer van mij..
je houd je nu wel groot maar gaat kapot van de pijn..
omdat je bij me wilt zijn maar niet meer bij me kunt zijn..
en is dit dan het eind van een hele rotte tijd..
alles is verlore en wat heb je nu bereikt..
want je bent me nu kwijt maar pas achteraf krijg je spijt..

ik loop nu vaker in me eentje over straat..
vele mensen vragen hoe het met me gaat..
gek genoeg zijn ze allemaal verbaast..
als ik ze zeg dat ik ook door moet gaan..
zoveel kansen gekregen in me leven..
zoveel gemist omdat ik dacht aan ons tweeën..
was nooit van plan om een spel met je te spelen..
maar achteraf heb jij het tegendeel bewezen..
ik moet er nu egt aan geloven..
want onze liefde is afgelopen..
ik ben nu egt gestopt met hopen..
heb eindelijk voor mezelluf gekozen..
tis niet alleen jouw schuld dat weet ik..
tzijn niet alleen jouw fouten die we niet vergeten..
maar tog heb ik me best gedaan..
en moeten wij ieder een kant op gaan..

want ik ben niet meer van jouw, jij bent niet meer van mij..
je houd je nu wel groot maar gaat kapot van de pijn..

en is dit dan het eind van een hele rotte tijd..
alles is verlore en wat heb je nu bereikt..
want je bent me nu kwijt maar pas achteraf krijg je spijt..

droog je tranen ga nu verder want je moet er doorheen..
hou je sterruk ja geloof me want je bent niet alleen..
het is pittig het is moeilijk en ik voel met je mee..
want het leven is niet altijd makkelijk nee nee..
droog je tranen ga nu verder want je moet er doorheen..

Lyrics:

[Part I Odysseus' Theme / Overture]
[music / orchestration - Romeo]

[instrumental]

[Part II - Journey to Ithaca]
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch
again, forever, two souls as one

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true

Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
but the tide is changing, and with it all my fears

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true

Behold the sea and winds of jove
We set sail guided by the stars above
The ports of Troy escape our view
a cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous

Onward we ride, into the raging fury
Setting our course by the moon and sun
We forge ahead seeking glory
Yet the journey has just begun

Onward we ride - nine days we brave her might
we are coming home...

[Part III - The Eye]
[music- Romeo]
[lyrics - Romeo]

Awakened at dawn - Land dead ahead
with the winds of the morning we change course
no remorse, a place forbidden to all

Search all the grounds - find food and water
Yet journey not into the Cave of Woe
long ago, a legend spoke of a beast

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares mortal blood forever flows

A mountainous black - engulfed in a shadow
a bone-chilling growl and an Eye of Hate
a ghastly fate - held prisoner by the Eye

Yet he must sleep - as the daylight fades
we focus our senses and sharpen our blade
we take aim - In silence we strike

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares - blood runs forever - from the Eye...

[Part IV - Circe (Daughter of the Sun)]
[music - Romeo]
[Lyrics - Romeo]

We sit adrift on the open sea
The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed - so carelessly
We break the waves on a course untrue
across the endless plain of blue - a new coast in view

Yeah...

We carouse with the maiden
beneath her eyes the madness lies
...in mystery

I drink deep from the chalice
of gold and jade - my senses fade
...I'm mesmerized

Stay - like those before
I condemn you all - from walk to crawl
...metamorphasized

No - my will it defies her
speak the verse - lift the curse
...she's mesmerized

Am I asleep?
Tell me Daughter of the Sun
There's vengeance in the air and all things must be undone

[Part V - Sirens]
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Romeo]

Dire warnings -
told by the sorceress in white
'false bringers of love' - Sirens
echoing songs from above

Wings flowing -
floating on Sea of Lies
I defy their vision
Elysium swallows my cries

Embracing -
maidens of lust stimulate
and manipulate my senses
I welcome a watery grave

Tied steadfast to the mast
tragedy awaits me
I'm falling victim
betrayed by the sea

[Part VI - Scylla and Charybdis]

[a) Gulf of Doom]
[b) Drifting Home]
[music / orchestration - Romeo]

[instrumental]

[Part VII - The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca]
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Lepond, Romeo]

So this is home...
In the guise of a beggar - Minerva guides my way
I find my kingdom in jeopardy

Vengeance - it swells within me
As I spy so many who eye my Queen
I'll make them pay for this blasphemy... All will see

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
my journey has come to an end

A contest of valor
'to pierce the twelve rings
in a single arrow's flight'
Yet, not a one can string the bow

My veil of silence lifted
All is revealed
revenge burns in my heart
thrashing and slashing down all my foes...to claim the throne

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
this is the end of my Odyssey

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm finally home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
I have returned to make my dream come true",211,1448,0,0,7439,2011-03-16 20:49:04,0,"Symphony, The, Odyssey",Symphony X - The Odyssey,MaN3pwBsRf8,1143392,CMgBEAA,x,0,11,3,16,75,2,6.0581951492495945,3.0934216851622347,3.8715145587083817,2.3242824552976926,6,11,0.05066874098124098,695,0.0,2,0.0,4,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,24,0.6390541181539741,0.5106177019644879,1.665681617087507,0,0,0.0

Sometimes a song comes along that I can't shake. I listen to it over and over again, and can't stop myself from wanting to be a part of it. ""Only"" by RY X was perfect as it was, but I wondered if I could flip it into something I could play in my late-night sets. I pulled Lipless into the mix and we came up with this. Enjoy.

Music: Andrew Lloyd Webber
Lyrics: Tim Rice
The song was written in 1976 in memory of Evita Perón, the second wife of Argentine President Juan Perón.
Footage in the video is from the film: «Eva Perón» by Juan Carlos Desanzo, starring Esther Goris and Victor Laplace.
The song was initially performed by Julie Covington and its name came from an inscription on the plaque of Evita Peron's grave at Recoleta cemetery in Buenos Aires.
Madonna sang the same song in 1996, in the musical drama: Evita, directed by Alan Parker and written by Parker and Oliver Stone. The film starred Madonna as Evita Perón, Antonio Banderas as Ché and Jonathan Pryce as Juan Perón.

It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
when I try to explain how I feel
that I still need your love after all that I've done.
You won't believe me
all you will see is a girl you once knew
although she's dressed up to the nines
at sixes and sevens with you.

I had to let it happen, I had to change
couldn't stay all my life down at heel
looking out of the window, staying out of the sun.
So I chose freedom
running around, trying everything new
but nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to.

Don't cry for me Argentina
the truth is I never left you
all through my wild days
my mad existence
I kept my promise
don't keep your distance.

And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
though it seemed to the world they were all I desired.
They are illusions
they are not the solutions they promised to be
the answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me.

Don't cry for me Argentina.

Don't cry for me Argentina
the truth is I never left you
all through my wild days
my mad existence
I kept my promise
don't keep your distance.

Have I said too much?
there's nothing more I can think of to say to you
but all you have to do is look at me to know
that every word is true.",4381,335,0,0,63243,2015-02-05 12:18:33,1,"Don't cry for me Argentina, Madonna, Eva, Perón, Evita, Eva Peron",Don't Cry For Me Argentina - Madonna,MEMUsC8ppU0,19811389,CMgBEAA,t,0,15,2,5,36,3,7.296914925507659,3.5388249889379035,4.8010124629765425,3.641573253178176,7,6,0.1324609733700643,323,0.0,5,0.0,6,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,36,0.6579509987424622,0.4849755033551664,1.318389643483478,0,0,0.0

Lyrics:

She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free

She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got the perfect friends
Oh isn't she cool

She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me

Hey hey

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
And don't bother
I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind",3314,273,0,1,71436,2009-10-03 04:48:28,1,"empire, Don't Bother spanish version, she wolf, acoustic, music, live performance hd, instrumental, waka waka, hd, Shakira Don't Bother official, la tortura, vevo, Shakira Don't Bother, Shakira lyrics, ShakiraVevo, official, download, Shakira live, karaoke, remix, hd 1080p original, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, la la la brazil 2014, Don't Bother live, hips dont lie, whenever wherever, loca, and rihanna cant remember to forget you, hq",Shakira - Don't Bother,MjRRQdnOR-A,35836926,CPoBEAA,t,0,9,10,3,276,5,7.554330749916063,3.780317312140151,4.853917128599378,3.520352504083318,7,40,0.4215686274509803,143,0.1568181818181818,31,0.0,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0.642534367277116,0.5004172357931449,1.3788156506966944,1,0,0.0

Lyrics:

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke â?? I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[Chorus:]
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving

Policeman says, Son, you can't stay here.
I said, There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows.
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.

BTS comes back with the 3rd mini album [The most beautiful moment in life pt.1]. With the new album, you can meet BTS who are not just young boys anymore but gradully growing.  Each track has lyrical and pop feelings showing small and big musical changes. 

The title song ‘I NEED U’ is an urban style electro hiphop song with the harmony of lyrical and oriental main theme and wild hiphop. The song applies electric source for sounds so it feels quite different to the previous songs of BTS. ‘I NEED U’ sings desperate heart trying to hold the love running down to the end.

防弾少年団が三枚目のミニアルバム『花様年華pt.1』でカムバックした。
ただの少年ではない、少しずつ成長していく防弾少年団に会うことができるアルバム。
各トラックごとに叙情的でポップ的な感じが溶け込んで、
音楽的に大小の変化を感じることができる。

タイトル曲の「I NEED U」は、アーバンスタイルが融合したエレクトロヒップホップ曲。
叙情性が加味された東洋的なメインテーマとワイルドなヒップホップが融合された歌。
サウンド的にエレクトリックソースを使用して防弾少年団の過去の音楽とはまた違った感じを与える。
「I NEED U」は、終わりに向かって墜落する愛を止めようとする切ない気持ちを表現している。

방탄소년단이 세 번째 미니앨범 [화양연화 pt.1]으로 돌아왔다. 이젠 마냥 어리기만 한 소년이 아닌, 조금씩 성장하고 있는 방탄소년단을 만날 수 있는 음반이다. 각 트랙마다 서정적이고 팝적인 느낌이 녹아있어, 음악적으로 크고 작은 변화를 느낄 수 있다.

타이틀곡인 ‘I NEED U’는 어반 스타일이 접목된 일렉트로 힙합곡이다. 서정성이 가미된 동양적인 메인 테마와 와일드한 힙합이 결합된 노래다. 사운드적으로 일렉트릭 소스를 사용해 방탄소년단의 지난 음악과는 또 다른 느낌으로 다가온다. ‘I NEED U’에는 끝을 향해 추락하는 사랑을 붙잡아 보려는 애타는 마음이 담겨있다.",2876,333,0,0,370399,2015-05-10 15:00:01,0,"원더케이, 1theK, 로엔, 로엔티비, 로엔뮤직, loen, loentv, loenmusic, 韓流, 韓国, kpop, artist, mv, teaser, 뮤비, 티져, ロエン, ミュージック, テレビ, ミュージックビデオ, ティーザー, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, エスエフ, シー・エス・アイ, ２４時間前, レッツダンス, 踊り, ダンス, 振付け, インタビュー, イベント, ラントゥユー, ライブ, new song, 신곡, 방탄소년단, 컴백 트레일러, 빅히트, bts, comeback trailer, big hit, 花樣年華, 화양연화, I NEED U",[MV] BTS(방탄소년단) _ I NEED U (Original ver.),2gWIjRqvtnI,13596071,CGQQAA,u,0,15,5,10,130,6,7.133413423844805,4.280396238060143,5.568669805507013,3.4587888817108454,7,19,0.12904040404040404,251,0.06818181818181818,45,0.375,7,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,42,0.7806458808195056,0.6000488102585076,1.6100056973562789,1,0,0.0

ไม่ธรรมดา (Cover ศิลปิน เบล สุพล)
คำร้อง/ทำนอง แมนสรวง สุรางครัตน์
เรียบเรียง วัฒนกร ศรีวัง

คนธรรมดาที่ไม่ธรรมดา เคยเดินตามหาก็ไม่เจอสักราย
แค่คนคนหนึ่งที่มีผลทางใจ ที่เจอก็ไม่ใช่ ที่ใช่ก็ไม่เจอ

คนธรรมดาที่ไม่ธรรมดา ที่สุดฟ้าก็พาให้มาพบเธอ
เธอคือคนเดียวที่ไม่ต้องเลิศเลอ
แต่อยู่ใกล้เธอเหมือนเจอสวรรค์ในหัวใจ

จบแล้วที่เสาะหา ได้มาพบตัวจริงซะที
ชีวิตต่อจากนี้ คงจะดีถ้ามีแต่เธอ
ก่อนจะนอนอยากเจอเธอเป็นคนสุดท้าย
คนแรกของเช้าถัดไปฉันก็อยากเห็นเธอ
เช้าก็มีแต่เธอ ค่ำก็มีแต่เธอ คนเดียวเท่านั้น

อยากทำตัวติดเธอไม่ต้องห่างไปไหน
ไม่ว่าจะทำอะไรก็อยากทำด้วยกัน
ทุกลมหายใจเข้าออก ทุกเวลาของฉัน
โว้ โอ โอ... อยากจะใช้กับเธอ

มันช่างคุ้ม คุ้มกับการรอคอย
เหนื่อยไม่น้อยที่คอยเฝ้าเจอตั้งนาน
แต่ในนาทีแรกที่ได้เห็นหน้ากัน นาทีนั้นรู้เลยว่าคุ้มที่รอ

Laboratorium Pieśni śpiewa tradycyjnie, w wielogłosie pieśni: ukraińskie, bałkańskie, polskie, białoruskie, a także gruzińskie, skandynawskie i wiele innych. Pieśni świata wykonują zarówno a capella, jak i przy akompaniamencie bębnów szamańskich i innych etnicznych instrumentów (m.in. shruti box, dzwonków, przeszkadzajek, fletu, kalimby, mis, gongu), wnosząc w pieśni tradycyjne nową przestrzeń improwizacji głosowych, inspirowanych dźwiękami natury, często intuicyjnych, dzikich, kobiecych.

Using traditional, polyphonic singing Laboratorium Pieśni perform songs from all over the world, mainly: Ukraine, Balkans, Poland, Belarus, Georgia, Scandinavia and many other places. They sing a capella as well as with shaman drums and other ethnic instruments (shruti box, kalimba, flute, gong, zaphir and koshi chimes, singing bowls, rattles etc.), creating a new space in a traditional song, adding voice improvisations, inspired by sounds of nature, often intuitive, wild and feminine.",187,177,0,1,11758,2015-03-14 14:15:20,0,"laboratorium pieśni, pieśni, laboratorium, ulisi, pieśń tradycyjna, muzyka tradycyjna, tradycja, pieśń ukraińska, ukrainian song, traditional music, ukraine, etno, alina jurczyszyn, labolatorium, labolatorium piesni, pieśń, world, folk, Ой y лиси, u lisi, shaman, chant, ukraina, białoruś, belarus, drum, tribe, slavic music, slavs, muzyka słowiańska, słowianie, pagan, song laboratory",Laboratorium Pieśni - U lisi (Ой y лиси),dn1iz_O1ikA,1350638,CKwCEAA,u,0,15,3,14,73,5,6.130538964366951,2.562292864456474,4.070333455853063,2.271841606536499,6,11,0.1053030303030303,201,0.0,32,0.0,7,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,40,0.6639438195420346,0.41795556301811404,1.7916449122782052,1,0,0.0

Jan. 5, 2016, Dalshabet (Serri, Ayoung, Woohee, and Subin) will return a four-member group in celebration of their 5th year since debut.
 
The title song ""Someone like U"" is well anticipated, since it's the first work Dalshabet has done with the hit song maker Brave Brothers. This track is a piece of perfection, with its quality built by the Brave Brothers and other Brave Sound label song writers like JS, Glen Choi (dj nure), and American popping music composers Fingazz, Chantelle Paige, and more. Its retro sounds and feels will remind the listeners of the 80/90s dance numbers. The catchy chorus really brings out Dalshabet's funky fun charms as well.

2016年1月5日、ダルシャーベット（セリ、アヨン、ウヒ、スビン）は、デビュー5周年を記念すると同時に、4人組に変わった姿でカムバックする。

タイトル曲「あなたのような」は、ヒット作曲家‘勇敢な兄弟’とダルシャーベットの初の出会いで、期待感を高める曲である。‘勇敢な兄弟’をはじめ、ブレイブサウンド所属の作曲家JS、Glen Choi（dj nure）、アメリカポッピン音楽の巨匠Fingazz、Chantelle Paigeなど、海外の作曲家たちとコラボレーションして、高いクオリティを作り上げた。80/90年代を代表するレトロなサウンドと感性を感じることができるダンス曲であり、ダルシャーベットのハツラツとした魅力がよく調和された曲で、中毒性の強いサビ部分が印象的である。

2016년 1월 5일, 달샤벳(세리, 아영, 우희, 수빈)은 데뷔 5주년을 기념하는 동시에 4인조로 변화된 모습으로 컴백한다.

타이틀곡 ‘너 같은’은 히트 작곡가 용감한 형제와 달샤벳의 첫 만남으로 기대감을 높이는 곡이다. 용감한 형제를 비롯해 브레이브 사운드 소속 작곡가 JS, Glen Choi (dj nure), 미국 팝핀음악의 거장 Fingazz, Chantelle Paige 등 해외 작곡가들과 콜라보레이션한 곡으로 높아진 퀄리티를 만들어 냈다. 80/90년대를 대표하는 레트로한 사운드와 감성을 느낄 수 있는 댄스곡이며 달샤벳의 톡톡 튀는 매력이 잘 혼합된 곡으로 중독성 강한 후렴구가 인상적이다.",1555,203,0,1,80102,2016-01-05 03:00:00,0,"원더케이, 1theK, 로엔, 로엔티비, 로엔뮤직, loen, loentv, loenmusic, 韓流, 韓国, kpop, artist, mv, teaser, 뮤비, 티져, ロエン, ミュージック, テレビ, ミュージックビデオ, ティーザー, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, エスエフ, シー・エス・アイ, ２４時間前, レッツダンス, 踊り, ダンス, 振付け, インタビュー, イベント, ラントゥユー, ライブ, new song, 신곡, 달샤벳, 너 같은, Dalshabet, Someone like U",[MV] Dalshabet(달샤벳) _ Someone like U(너 같은),6H1QOFBNRWs,7723887,CKwCEAA,u,0,16,1,5,5,1,6.887835911451812,3.69407846208076,4.90364335975615,3.191730393362856,6,1,0.4096153846153846,254,0.13636363636363635,40,0.0,6,0,2,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,0.7119280166943706,0.5363191733326478,1.5363588885681525,0,0,0.0

DALMACIJA U MOM OKU

Autor glazbe: Dušan Šarac
Autor teksta:  Krste Juras

Pitaju me zašto pjevam 
o tom moru, buri, jugu
govore mi kako sanjam 
obećanu zemlju drugu

Govore mi da se trgnem 
dok je vrijeme, dok se može
k'o da mogu isprat kiše 
onu davnu sol sa kože
 
Vidim jata onih istih ptica
istu zvijezdu previsoku
opet živi stotinama lica
Dalmacija u mom oku

Znam da nije bila samo moja
možda sam u snu duboku
ali živi stotinama boja
Dalmacija u mom oku

Govore mi čemu priče
ljudi drugi život žive
odvezane sve su barke
i brodovi s tvoje rive

Ali negdje zvona zvone
i skidaju ljudi kape
i dok dječji plač se čuje
sastaju se nove klape

Vidim jata onih istih ptica
istu zvijezdu previsoku
opet živi stotinama lica

LYRICS: 
Last night put the heavy on me 
Woke up, and I’m feeling lonely 
This world gotta a way of showin’ me 
Some days it’ll lift you up 
Some days it’ll call your bluff 
Man, most of my days I ain’t got enough 

And all I know is You’re my only hope 

When I’m up, when I’m down 
When the wolves come around 
When my feet hit the ground 
I just need, I just need U 
On my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
No, it ain’t gonna change 
I just need, I just need U 
Lord, I need U 
Yeah, I just need U 

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil for thou art with me 
Thy rod and thy staff … 
They comfort me when I’m beat down broken 
Hold my heart when it’s split wide-open 
Turn these eyes to my sole protector 
And break the will of this born defector 

When You pull me closer I come to life 

Ain’t no way this thing gon’ change, it’s U 
I need on my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
I need U every single day, every breath I take 
I need U

Wandering the streets all through the night,
Searching for the one to make me right.
Wondering if she's the shade of you,
And If so, should I try to see it through.

Darling, I got my trust issues.
Warning, you stay away.
If we meet at the rendezvous,
take me away, Sunray

Time and toys,
May fill my heart with joy,
I'll know peace when I'm your lover boy.

I'll be your new school soul.
Silver and gold.
New desire.
Friends on fire.

Lyrics: 
There goes my heart beating 
Cause you are the reason 
I'm losing my sleep 
Please come back now 

There goes my mind racing 
And you are the reason 
That I'm still breathing 
I'm hopeless now 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 

There goes my hands shaking 
Cause you are the reason 
My heart keeps bleeding 
And I need you now 

If I could turn back the clock 
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark 
I'd spend every hour, of every day 
Keeping you safe 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 
You are the reason 
Yeah, yeah... 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason

Lyrics:

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger""

Life has a rhythm, it's constantly moving.
The word for rhythm ( used by the Malinke tribes ) is FOLI.
It is a word that encompasses so much more than drumming, dancing or sound.
It's found in every part of daily life.
In this film you not only  hear and feel rhythm but you  see it.
It's an extraordinary blend of image and sound that
feeds the senses and reminds us all
how essential it is.

Lyrics:

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah.

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting

LYRICS
Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so, sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So, don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are
The way you are, the way you are
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while

Witaj kochanie, czy jeszcze pamiętasz
Tych parę chwil kiedy otwierał się szemrany raj
Dalej jesteś jak kwiat, jesteś jak mięta
Co przed motylem cała drży i lgnie, lecz kielich w dół

Przytulona w trawie
Myślałaś co się dzieje w nas
Może to zwykły bawidamek
Lowelas, co kochanek setki ma
Przytulona w trawie,
Myślałaś co tu dzieje się
Może to zwykły bawidamek
I zaraz cię zostawi bałaś się

I nie wiedziałaś co masz robić...
Co masz zrobić z nim

Witaj kochanie, wiem, że nie mam szans
A przecież z nikim nie mam takich ciar
I ty nie masz też
Myślisz, że jestem groźny, że jestem przeklęty
Ja chcę pokazać tylko zranione serce, co do ciebie lgnie

Przytulona w trawie...

Znów jesteśmy sami i nie ma się już czego bać
I wiesz już, że to czarne serce, gotowe, by w twe ręce siebie dać
Znów jesteśmy sami i wszystko to odeszło w dal
I wiesz już, że to czarne serce wciąż czeka by w twe ręce
Siebie dać

Ty dalej nie wiesz co masz robić...

Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc. and Bill Botrell

THE SHORT FILM
Director: John Landis
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Black or White"" was the first of nine short films produced for recordings from Dangerous, Michael's fourth album as an adult solo performer. As a single, ""Black or White"" was an international sensation, topping the charts in 20 countries in 1991 and 1992, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

""Black or White"" was certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 6, 1992. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male in 1993. Both ""Black or White"" and its follow-up ""Remember the Time"" received BMI Urban Awards in 1993 for being two of the most performed songs of the year.

The ambitious ""Black or White"" short film again found Michael pushing the boundaries of the ""music video"" as art form. (This edited version of the short film was created for mainstream airtime after controversy arose over the final ""panther sequence."") 

An extended prologue stars Macaulay Culkin as a boy whose father (George Wendt) is angered by the playing of loud rock music after bedtime. After being admonished for ""wasting your time with this garbage,"" Culkin vengefully plugs a guitar into an enormous speaker, blasting his father out of the house and across the globe, still sitting in his easy chair.

Lyrics: 
Reckless Love
Written by Cory Asbury, Caleb Culver, and Ran Jackson

Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge

There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down

Letra ""Sin Querer Queriendo""'

Hoy te siento más cerquita, quizá.
Esta noche esta oscurita demás.
Me hizo falta compañía, verdad
y yo te vine a buscar.

Dale goza y después me ignoras, ven
que tú no estás firmando nada conmigo.
Goza y después me ignoras ven
que tú no estas firmando nada conmigo.

You and me,
nobody but you and me.
You and me,
nobody but you, nobody but you.

Sin querer, sin querer
lo de ayer fue sin querer
pero parecía queriendo.

No sé lo que me pasa, yo no duermo en otra cama
pero te veía muy contenta conmigo.
No sé lo que me pasa, yo no duermo en otra cama
pero terminaste acurrucada conmigo.

Yo tengo muy claro lo que pasó ayer
yo tuve la culpa pero tu también,
Pero repitamos, pero.
Pero repitamos para acordarme bien…

Que estaba sola
y yo que no te daba bola
pero llegó el descontrol
y pasó el alcohol,
se llevó la ropa.

Ay, estaba sola
y yo que no te daba bola
pero llegó el descontrol
y pasó el alcohol,
se llevo la ropa.

Dale goza…

And yet the duo doesn't play heavy metal — its members perform instrumentals on nylon-string guitars — nor does it play Spanish dance music. But the term fits because the pair's fierce guitar riffs feel powerfully electric, and because Rodrigo y Gabriela's rhythmic style showcases a frenetic strum that conjures the energy of flamenco.

The duo have just released a new album titled, 11:11, which pays tribute to the pair's heroes — Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, Astor Piazzolla and Pantera's Dimebag Darrell.

Letras:

Tengo que confesar que a veces, no me gusta tu forma de ser, 
luego te me desapareces y no entioendo muy bien por qué? 
No dices nada romántico cuando llega el atardecer, 
te pones de un humor extraño con cada luna llena al mes. 

Pero todo lo demás le gana lo bueno que me das, 
solo tenerte cerca, siento que vuelvo a empezar. 

Yo te quiero con limón y sal, yo te quiero tal 
y como estas no hace falta cambiarte nada. 
Yo te quiero si vienes o si vas, si subes 
y bajas si no estas seguro de lo que sientes. 

Tengo que confesarte ahora, nunca creí en la felicidad, 
a veces algo se le parece pero es pura casualidad.""",8946,216,0,1,231414,2009-10-03 05:48:27,1,"Julieta Venegas, te vi, JulietaVenegasvevo, vídeo, limon y sal, en vivo, official, mtv unplugged, video, instrumental, music video, álbum, música, album, hd, Me Voy, despedida, Limón y sal, vevo, oficial, Julieta Venegas Oficial, el presente, eres para mi, ese camino, karaoke, remix, andar conmigo, portada, audio, Julieta Venegas Limon Y Sal letra, algo esta cambiando, JulietaVenegasVEVO, bien o mal, lento, Sony, Julieta Venegas en vivo",Julieta Venegas - Limon Y Sal (Video),tIpzfs5tBJU,70943007,CPoBEAA,y,0,9,10,3,276,5,7.850909592591382,3.853819845856763,5.364389629200113,3.9516288938366384,7,40,0.0,207,0.0,35,0.0,6,0,3,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,3,0,0,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,37,0.6832825631137434,0.4908755858675882,1.3575135148867246,1,0,0.0

Musica Relajante para Estudiar y Concentrarse y Memorizar. Musica de Relajacion para Estudiar 

Si necesitas concentrarte porque llegan ya los exámenes y no lo consigues, una solución pasa por escuchar música relajante para estudiar que ayuda a concentrarse y memorizar. Esta práctica aporta múltiples beneficios cuando tienes que ponerte con los estudios ya que escuchando música tranquila de fondo para estudiar consigues que tu mente y todo tu cerebro se relaje y se despeje, evitando distracciones y aumentando el grado de concentración así como la capacidad para memorizar.

Oír música basada en sonidos y piezas de piano tranquilizantes y calmados mientras estudias es uno de los recursos que debes usar si quieres sacar tus estudios con éxito. Otras recomendaciones que hacemos desde el canal de Youtube de “Musica Relajante” que te ayudarán a estudiar son:

Crear un ambiente de trabajo o estudio ordenado, limpio, libre de distracciones como puede ser tu teléfono celular. Intenta mantenerlo apagado o en silencio mientras estas concentrado o memorizando. 

Es mejor estudiar durante el día que por la noche pues en las últimas horas la mente ya está más fatigada y agotada.

Haz una vida sana. Buena alimentación, descansar adecuadamente y hacer deporte con regularidad te ayudará a que tu mente esté más predispuesta a aprender y reflexionar.

Planificar las horas de estudio diarias y no dejarlos para última hora.

La musica relajante para estudiar y concentrarse y memorizar de piano no solo la puedes escuchar en las horas que estás estudiando y aprendiendo. También es apropiada en los recomendados descansos es posible que suenen estas melodías  de relajación para despejar la mente, para meditar, reflexionar y renovar energías.

¡Mucho ánimo y mucha suerte con tus estudios!

LETRA

ENTRE POETAS Y PRESOS

Somos mil manos haciendo un túnel, desde las minas hasta las nubes
Somos cizallas contra el candado, final de un cuento, nunca acabado
Somos la fuerza de la estampida, somos el mundo patas arriba
Somos hijos de unos pocos locos que dibujaron la salida
Caballo en Troya y en sus castillos, cientos de gritos contra el pestillo
Somos el preso, libre entre rejas, pasamontañas, rompecabezas
Somos el llanto y la carcajada, los empujones a la alambrada
Somos los que fueron tanto siendo nada
Y en ese pozo de ley y de orden, de sucias sombras, de servidumbre, 
Pasa que ustedes nos odian, pasa que ustedes nos odian porque...

Somos los hijos de los versos de los poetas y los presos
La voz que grita entre los huesos de las cunetas para despertar…al universo

Somos el odio contra el garrote, la disidencia que sale a flote
La noche al raso del fugitivo, somos el puño, con el latido
La primavera más valenciana, somos la escuela multiplicada
Somos los que fueron tanto siendo nada
Y en ese pozo de ley y de orden, de sucias sombras, de servidumbre, 
Pasa que ustedes nos odian, pasa que ustedes nos odian porque...

Somos los hijos de los versos de los poetas y los presos
La voz que grita entre los huesos de las cunetas para despertar…al universo

Él soñó siempre con verte
Gloria a ti, a ti, mujer del preso
Le causó pavor la muerte
Gloria a ti, a ti, mujer del preso

ORACIÓN POR LOS HIJOS #2

Bendito y amoroso Jesus, lleno de ternura y sencillez, grandes son tus maravillas y tus prodigios, muchas gracias por siempre estar conmigo y nunca abandonarme, mil gracias porque aunque aveces no te sienta, yo se que tu nunca me abandonas. 
Mi amoroso y hermoso Jesús me arrepiento de todos mis errores y faltas hechas contra Ti y contra mi prójimo, confío en tu infinita e inagotable misericordia. 

Mi amado Jesus te pido por mis hijos, hoy vengo ante ti implorando tu bondad para que siempre los protejas de todo mal, hoy invoco tu nombre y tu sangre preciosa sobre sus vidas y sobre sus caminos, sobre sus planes y sus pensamientos para que todo lo que ellos hagan sea de acuerdo a tu voluntad. No dejes que se alejen de tus benditas manos, no los sueltes mi bello Jesus  de tu presencia. Nunca dejes que se desvíen por las sendas del mal. Nunca te olvides de ellos aunque ellos se olviden de Ti, acuérdate Señor que eres el Dios del amor y que tu perdón nunca los deje. 

Mi adorado Jesús que sabes muy bien lo que es ser padre, pues Tu eres Padre de todos nosotros y sufres cuando un hijo tuyo se va de tu presencia. Asi como el hijo prodigo le pidio su parte de la herencia que le tocaba a su padre, se fue y malgasto todo lo que tenia, sufrió hambre y sed, y hasta que recapacitó y decidió volver con su padre arrepentido y dispuesto a cambiar.  Asi también amadisimo Señor bondadoso, si mis hijos se han desviado, si mis hijos se han ido, si mis hijos han sido desobedientes, yo siempre estaré aquí para perdonarlos y para recibirlos con los brazos abiertos cuando gusten volver a este humilde hogar. 

Padre celestial humildemente y con cariño te pido que rompas en mi todas las cadenas que traigo arrastrando de mi pasado, toda cadena que heredé de mis padres, todo lo malo que traigo en mi ser de mis antepasados que no se los pase yo a mis hijos. Te pido bendito Señor de misericordia que si mis padres no me mostraron su amor con cariño, con un beso, con palabras, con un abrazo, que no aga yo lo mismo con mis hijos, sino al contrario que yo les de todo ese amor y cariño que yo no recibí cuando era pequeno. 

Ayudame Jesus bendito a no dar lo malo que yo arrastre de mis padres a mis hijos, si no más bien, darles el buen ejemplo de la virtud, de la bondad, de poner tu evangelio en hechos y no solo de palabras porque muchas veces nuestros hijos están cansados que les hablemos de tu amor si nosotros mismos no practicamos lo que decimos.  

Mi precioso Jesús te pido que cuides a mis hijos a donde quiera que vayan, especialmente cuando andan en lugares que no deben de ir, cuando están con personas que no deben de estar, cuidalos y protegelos cuando el enemigo los acecha, cuando el mal los espera para atraparlos, allí mi Señor pon tu mano protectora, allí Señor manda tus ángeles en su ayuda, allí Madre santísima socorrelos en sus peligros, socorrelos si van a tener algún accidente, si alguien quiere hacerles daño, Madre hermosa Maria cubrelos con tu manto como la gallina cubre a sus pollitos del enemigo. 

Oh hermosa Madre celestial que siempre tienes a mis hijos en tu corazón inmaculado, tú que siempre los llevas de tu mano y que tienes un lugar muy especial para ellos en tu corazón lleno de amor y de ternura. Te pido Madre que cubras sus ojos para que no vean lo impuro, cubre sus pies para que no caminen por el mal camino, cubre sus manos para que no se dejen llevar por la tentación, cubre su boca para que no hablen lo prohibido, cubre su corazón para que siempre sea consagrado a ti, cubre su alma para que siempre les tengas un lugar reservado en el cielo. Y cubre todo su ser para que siempre y en cada momento ellos lleven siempre a Jesús y ti Madre santísima en los más profundo de su alma. 

Te agradezco mi adorado Jesús grandemente por que siempre llevas en la palma de tu mano a mis hijos y gracias por cuidarlos en cada momento. Jesus, en Ti confio.

Te llame borracho y bien arrebatado 
llamada perdida, el celu explotado 
mala mia baby, que estaba burlado 
y yo se que eres feliz con el a tu lado 

Pero me importa un carajo 
se que me guille y te cogí de relajo 
pero te llame, triste y cabis bajo 
si no me contestas llego a tu trabajo 

Yo se que el te ama y te trata bien 
pero yo te extraño y te quiero también 
yo se que te falle y no bregue al cien 
pero haciendotelo, como yo no hay quien 

Te llame borracho a ver si te veo 
si no me pajeo, con todos los videos 
que yo me encontré en el celu viejo 
chingando contigo en el puteo 

Te volvi a llamar en la madrugada 
pensando si tu, aun en mi pensabas 
pero estabas con el, solo no estabas 
con el estabas, mientras te anhelada 

Te llame borracho, estabas con un macho 
te dije te amo, de frente de los muchachos 
te llame borracho y me hablaste dormida 
baby yo te extraño y eres mía todavía (x2) 

Por más que estuve pensándolo toda la noche al fin te llame 
y te dije todas las cosas que llevo pensando decirte hace un mes 
yo se quete chocas y todo, pero me faltan cosas todavía 
por eso te llamo borracho, para confesarte todo lo que te haría 

Me falta morderte más duro 
me falta, me faltan unas cuantas poses 
por eso te llamo privado 
no importa la hora, ya tu me conoces 

El hombre que te hizo sentir 
caliente en las noches frías con su rose 
borracho después de las 12 
perdona ma que te acose 

Te llame borracho, estabas con un macho 
te dije te amo, de frente de los muchachos 
te llame borracho y me hablaste dormida 
baby yo te extraño y eres mía todavía (x2)

0,Kortez Oficjalny Kanał,702,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"01.10 ukazał się dwupłytowy album koncertowy Korteza, zarejestrowany wiosną tego roku. Dźwięk pochodzi z koncertu, który odbył się w krakowskim Klubie Studio 2 kwietnia, a obraz jest montażem z czterech koncertów - 30 marca Palladium, 1 i 2 kwietnia- Studio, oraz 15 kwietnia z Sali im. Krystyny Bochenek w Katowicach. Były to kolejno 8-my, 10-ty, 11-ty i 14-ty koncert Korteza z zespołem. 
Płyta ukazała się w bardzo małym nakładzie, nie trafiła do ogólnej sprzedaży i jest dystrybuowana głównie na koncertach oraz wysyłkowo przez sklep Side One. 

Jej premiera miała miejsce na koncercie 1 października w Opolu, w ramach tegorocznego Songwriters Festival. To właśnie na tym festiwalu 22 listopada 2014 Kortez zagrał swój pierwszy koncert w nieistniejącej już klubokawiarni Kontakt.
Po blisko dwóch latach wrócił do Opola z zespołem z by zagrać w Teatrze im. Jana Kochanowskiego.

Idea zarejestrowania koncertów zrodziła się na początku wiosny tego roku, na drugim koncercie Korteza z zespołem w Łodzi. 
„Byliśmy pod wrażeniem jak ten świeżo zmontowany zespół po czterech próbach już na drugim koncercie po prostu dobrze gra. Widać było chemię między muzykami i autentyczną radość z grania” – mówi Paweł „U-zek” Jóźwicki.

„Pomysł, że debiutant wydaje ''koncertówkę'' wydał nam się z początku szalony, ale z drugiej strony pomyśleliśmy, że może nigdy nie będzie już tak dobrze, że to świetny moment, bo wszyscy są podekscytowani i pełni zapału. I choć zupełnie nie byliśmy przygotowani na to technicznie ani logistycznie, a sama myśl o takim przedsięwzięciu nas przerażała, to chcieliśmy utrwalić jakoś tę chwilę – dla nas samych, dla Korteza i dla tych wszystkich, którzy towarzyszą temu od początku i mieli podobne odczucia na pamiątkę.” – dodaje Agata Trafalska odpowiedzialna za rejestrację wideo.

""Kamień z napisem LOVE"" to najnowszy singiel zespołu ENEJ, a jednocześnie trzeci promujący płytę ""Paparanoja"", która ukazała się zimą 2015 roku. Piosenka nawiązuje do dotychczasowej twórczości grupy, jej styl nie odbiega od tego z czym do tej pory kojarzył się ENEJ, jednak tym razem muzycy postanowili postawić na prostotę. Żartobliwy tekst, skromne instrumentarium i bardzo przyjemna melodia tworzą niesamowicie lekką, zabawną, miłą dla ucha mieszankę. ""Kamień z napisem LOVE"" z pewnością 
przypadnie do gustu zarówno fanom zespołu, jak i tym, którzy zetknęli się z grupą po raz pierwszy.

1,Genius,1171,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"JAY-Z and Kanye’s relationship has hit a rough patch. Hov recently unleashed some Ye subliminals on the '4:44' track “Kill Jay Z.” Two days after that song was released, reports surfaced that Kanye is planning to leave TIDAL, claiming he’s still owed $3 million from the streaming service. But from their history of competitiveness and shady exchanges, maybe we should have seen this coming all along.

Tábory TAPAZA jsou spojením tradičních a moderních táborů, které se svým osvědčeným týmem vedoucích s šestiletou táborovou praxí tvoří nezapomenutelných 10 prázdninových dní. Nejen pro menší děti, ale i dospívající teenagery je připraven široký výběr aktivit a zaměření spolu s profesionálním zábavným programem. Nabízíme výběr z devíti typů táborů, včetně letošní absolutní novinky „FLEXI tábor"", kde si přímo na táboře mohou účastníci poskládat program přesně podle svých představ. Navíc nabízíme několik doplňkových aktivit, jako jsou: návštěva největšího lanového centra v ČR -- Tarzánie, výlet do Aquaparku, motokáry atd. Ubytování v chatkách, dostačující sociální zázemí, bohatá a pestrá strava, celodenní pitný režim a profesionální zdravotní péče jsou pro nás samozřejmostí. Zkrátka nezáleží na tom, kolik ti je let, jestli jsi holka nebo kluk. Na našem táboře si vybereš program přesně podle sebe, užiješ si ty nejlepší prázdninové dny, poznáš spoustu nových kamarádů a odvezeš si nezapomenutelné zážitky.
