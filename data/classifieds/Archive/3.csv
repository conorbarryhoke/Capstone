Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes,
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know.
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson.

This video has a lot of flashing colors.  If you're susceptible to seizures, be careful, please.  Your viewing experience will look significantly better if you manually set your YouTube resolution settings to 1440p or 2160p (for desktop, click the gear icon in the lower right). Just leaving it on “Auto HD” results in some pretty intense distortion during a few sections, because when the the colors and patterns get crazy, there’s actually just too much information flying by for YouTube’s normal HD compression. We broke the matrix. The good people of YouTube have been working with us to solve this (it’s a bit rate limitation issue) over the last 24 hours, but there’s no quick fix, and now it’s Thanksgiving in the US, and we’re all with our families.

Lyrics 
Ed Sheeran- Shape of You

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

That it made you believe in

Maybe that's why

Neverseems enough for you

It was Elgar's Enigma Variations that made his name as a composer, at the age of forty-two. Today, Enigma is widely seen as the first real musicial masterpiece to emerge in Britain since the dead of Henry Purcell two centuries earlier. In the manuscript score the word ""Enigma"" is written over the original theme, with its contrasted strains of major and minor. Elgar later said that this theme represented ""the loneliness of the creative artist"", and one may assume that it therefore represents Elgar himself. He also said there was ""another and larger theme"" which ""goes"" through and over the whole set but is not played. Whether this second theme is a popular melody or a symbolic idea such as friendship has never been established and probably never will be.

First performed in London in June 1899 and conducted by Hans Richter, Elgar dedicated the Variations ""to my friends pictured within,"" and they form an irresistible sequence of character studies, culminating in the composer's rousing, assured self-portrait - as though he were telling those friends, ""See what you have made of me."". But Elgar also confessed that the music contained a ""dark saving"", adding that the theme itself expressed his enduring sense of the ""loneliness of the artist"". So like many of Elgar's finest works, Enigma reveals two very different personae: the robust, brimming confidence of the self-made English gentleman and the restless, melancholic introspection of the outsider. Thet Elgar gentleman and the restless, melancholic introspections of the outsider. That Elgar was truly both is one of the aspects of his music that makes him fascinating. That is not the whole story: Enigma is also about warmth of feeling, tunefulness, and lively humor, and even - an unashionable word today - Nobility. 

At the end of an overlong day laden with teaching and other duties, Edward Elgar lit a cigar, sat at his piano and began idling over the keys. To amuse his wife, the composer began to improvise a tune and played it several times, turning each reprise into a caricature of the way one of their friends might have played it or of their personal characteristics. ""I believe that you are doing something which has never been done before,"" exclaimed Mrs. Elgar. Thus was born one of music's great works of original conception, and Elgar's greatest large-scale ""hit"": the Enigma Variations. The enigma is twofold: each of the 14 variations refers to a friend of Elgar's, who is depicted by the nature of the music, or by sonic imitation of laughs, vocal inflections, or quirks, or by more abstract allusions. The other enigma is the presence of a larger ""unheard"" theme which is never stated but which according to the composer is very well known. The identity of the phantom tune left the world with the composer, and guesses have ranged from ""God Save the King"" to a simple major scale. 

This apparatus aside, the variations contain some of the most charming and deeply felt music Elgar ever penned, more than redeeming the work from the status of mere gimmickry. The main theme is hesitating, lean and haunting, and is reprised with the passionate first variation that represents Caroline, the composer's wife, a constant source of encouragement and inspiration.",93,2296,0,0,2099,2016-01-01 02:41:44,0,"Enigma Variations (Composition), Edward Elgar (Author), Edward Elgar (Composer), Enigma Variations (Musical Recording), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Conducted Ensemble), Leonard Bernstein (Conducter)","Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations | BBC Symphony Orchestra, Leonard Bernstein",6GbD20h8-_4,379101,CMgBEAA,a,0,16,1,1,1,4,5.578754930018387,2.322219294733919,3.3220124385824006,1.968482948553935,5,53,0.16309731934731933,664,0.0,5,0.0,9,0,7,0,1,3,4,0,2,2,4,0,0,1,2,6,3,1,0,7,4,3,0,0,1,0,2,0,76,0.5954755998882804,0.4162612130958521,1.687600312221541,0,1,3.0

All income will be used to build the Marble Machine 2.0, a full sized but transportable Marble Machine that we can tour with! I am going to build it in seven modular horcrux parts, every part has its own case. When we are playing we will arrive the day before the show to assemble it.

Lyrics
We still believe, we still believe
We still believe, we still believe
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home again
Tears for heroes dressed in grey
No plans for final day
Stay in bed, drift away
It could have been all
Songs in the street
It was nearly complete
It was nearly so sweet
And now I'm singing
Three lions on a shirt
Jules remains still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming
Talk about football coming home
And then one night in Rome
We were strong, we had grown
And now I see Ince ready for war
Gazza good as before
Shearer certain to score
And Psycho screaming
Three lions on a shirt
Jules remains still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming
We can dance Nobby's dance
We could dance it in France
It's coming home, it's coming home

LYRICS:
Frisse morgen in Parijs. 
Gewoon mijn business. 
Ik zie de meest mooie Française op d'r bung hoge hakken,
en ik weet niet wat ik zeggen moet. 
Ik zeg: bonjour mon amour, mademoiselle tu est très belle. 
En zij zegt: Je suis Néerlandais. Je parle un petit peu français.

En ik zei: 
Praat Nederlands met me. 
Even Nederlands met me. 
Mijn gevoel zegt mij dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élysées en naar de Notre Dame en naar de Seine. 
En daarna samen op La Tour Eiffel.

En ik voelde dat het goed zat. Ik zag haar zo verlegen lachen. 
Kan niet geloven dat het echt was. Zij de mijne zijn. 
Ze leek een mix van Doutzen, Edsilia en Anouk. 
Er gebeurde iets met mij,
toen zij zei: Je suis Néerlandais. Je parle un petit peu français.

En ik zei: 
Praat Nederlands met me. 
Even Nederlands met me. 
Mijn gevoel zegt mij dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élysées en naar de Notre Dame en naar de Seine. 
En daarna samen op La Tour Eiffel.
En dan nog een woordje Frans: Je t'aime! (6x)

Praat Nederlands met me. 
Even Nederlands met me. 
Mijn gevoel zegt mij dat wij vanavond samen kijken
Naar de Champs-Élysées en naar de Notre Dame en naar de Seine. 
En daarna samen landen op Schiphol.

Kenneth Bron, oftewel Kenny B, ofwel de Surinaamse zanger met de meeste nummer één hits in eigen land heeft zijn nieuwe album af. Na diverse succesvolle albums in het Engels, Aucaans en Sranantongo stapt Kenny B over op het Nederlands. Kenny B zingt al vanaf zijn achtste. Een tijd voerde hij de band ‘Fransisco’ aan en maakte hij muziek in de toneelgroep van het Surinaamse leger, ‘Mofo'. Op zijn 28e kwam Kenny B naar Nederland. Maar zijn succesvolle carrière zorgde ervoor dat hij regelmatig in het buitenland en nog veel vaker in Suriname te vinden was. 

Toch mag Kenny een muzikale laatbloeier genoemd worden. Pas sinds 2006 heeft de muziek zijn volledige aandacht. Het ging gelijk als een speer en twee van zijn albums werden overzees zelfs tot het beste van dat jaar gekroond. “Ik wilde mezelf eerst in het Engels en Surinaams in de spotlight zetten”, aldus Kenny B. “De overstap naar Nederlandstalig heeft altijd in mijn hoofd gespeeld, maar dat heb ik lang afgehouden. Kom je in het Engels niet beter weg met bepaalde woorden en uitdrukkingen?”

Kenny B stond al op de radar van Top Notch baas Kees de Koning. Op vakantie in Suriname, was er helemaal geen ontkomen meer aan. “Je hoorde bijna niets anders in Paramaribo. Uit elke auto en bar klonken zijn hits. Ik raakte geïntrigeerd en ben naar de bekende platenzaak Disco Amigo gegaan en heb er zijn cd’s gekocht. Toen ik terug was in Nederland heb ik gelijk met Kenny afgesproken.” Onder de indruk van zijn invalshoeken en de thematiek van de liedjes vroeg De Koning de zanger om een aantal van zijn teksten te vertalen naar het Nederlands. “Zes weken lang hoorde ik niets meer van hem en toen stuurde hij ineens twee gloednieuwe liedjes. Ik werd helemaal weggeblazen en een week later hadden we een deal.” 

Kenny’s single ‘Parijs’ is vanaf vandaag verkrijgbaar via iTunes en streamingdiensten.

🧢 ""Berretti"" è una ballad in forma strofica: il flusso continuo di un ricordo e di quanto sia semplice focalizzarci sui dettagli, sulla memoria delle cose dette o non dette, sugli errori fatti e i momenti mancati.

""Berretti"" è una storia mai iniziata e mai finita, un qualcosa rimasto intrappolato tra i tornelli del tempo.

In realtà mi piaci perché mi piace come ti vesti
e i tuoi occhi fanno strani percorsi pazzeschi
in realtà mi piacciono i tuoi cappelli
e come li metti quando li porti
Poi mi hai detto non sarà così per sempre

io non ti ho creduto
e ora passavo qui per caso
In realtà non ho molto da fare
anzi ti volevo dire
se ti va di aspettare
se ti va di aspettare
Ehi com’è
te lo dicevo sempre
è il mio essere banale
a sembrar così attraente
ma perché alle tue serate
non c’è mai da bere

Se ti va di aspettare la metro con me
potremmo perdere tutte le corse
poi fare un po' a botte
con le tue ossa rotte

1,Genius,1890,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Nicki Minaj and Cardi B’s fight during a Harpers Bazaar party at New York Fashion Week 2018 was the culmination of a long-simmering beef between the two rappers. While the origins of their feud is a little murky, fans speculated that Nicki and Cardi traded subliminals on songs such as “No Flag” and “No Limit (Remix),” respectively—although both MCs denied any such rumors.

► The CD version is now available on: https://shop.relaxdaily.net and
► Amazon: https://goo.gl/iodFWn

Use this in your relaxation music playlist, as yoga music or as meditation music. I know, this is not the ordinary music for meditation, but it works for many people. Use it as music while you're studying, doing homework, working mentally or creatively, while reading, writing, while thinking or reflecting, dreaming, reviewing, making future plans. Some use it as sleep music, though there might be even calmer sleep music out there for you....

Call it chillout, ambient, New Age, instrumental, or background music - this is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With the relaxdaily project, I try to take a little heat from our (generally) too busy lives. As a soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some positive, cooling, liberating tunes.

Hope you enjoy the music,
Have a great day,

Lyrics:
Turn the lights on
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

In part from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

""The Mass in B Minor is a musical setting of the Latin Mass. Although parts of the Mass in B Minor date to 1724, the whole was assembled in its present form in 1749, just before the composer's death in 1750. 
...

Due to its length--over two hours of music--it was never performed as part of a church liturgy. The first performance seems to have been after Bach's death, when his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach performed the Gloria section (but not the entire Mass) in Berlin. Large-scale performances of the entire Mass in B Minor were not staged until the 19th century.""

Lyrics:

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me
And I believe it (Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like u)

Now I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen em all but ain't none of them at all (like u)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (like u)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (like u)
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
Cause when we first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin or actin shady cause baby you kno",13163,281,0,1,416298,2009-10-25 19:55:19,1,"bowwow, BowWowVevo, Like You live, Shortie like mine, acoustic, ciara, music, Bow Wow Like You, hd, Like You lyrics, like you, shorty like mine, wow i want candy, girlfriend, official, download, remix, lyrics, wow yippy yo yippy yay, official video, cover, let me hold you, Bow Wow live, basketball, Bow Wow Like You official, Bow Wow, original, Sony, Vevo, music video, single, Bow Wow lyrics, album, live, hq, fresh azimiz, Bow Wow feat.

Perhaps there's no more jazz, and all that's left is improvised music, which draws its inspiration from the influences of our times, and history? Maybe that's where the Holy Grail of creation should be sought? Somewhere between that which created us, and that which we create?

VARS&KAPER – DeconstructiON is not simply a melding of the roots of Polish jazz, deeply founded in the film music of two composers: Henryk Wars and Bronisław Kaper, often interpreted by giants such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane, with the music of here and now. These are not just ear-pleasing, pretty Slavic melodies, embellished with a stroke of modernity. This is also a search for common ground, between a DJ and the ambiance of acoustic instruments. A place where the contemporary groove and sensibilities of a piano trio don't fight for a better tomorrow, but create a nexus between that which is past, and that which is modern. Like Yin and Yang. The great balance of Power.

0,Erolon,1,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"The album leaf is one of the many compositions that Chopin left unpublished during his life. As such it, it doesn't have an opus number but is instead often referred to with it's brown catalogue number. 
   Composed in 1843, the album leaf is a short piece fitting on one page. It is thematically similar to his nocturnes, but missing some of the mystical ingenuity that makes them so great. It is nonetheless a beautiful composition, and we can be glad it wasn't burned upon Chopin's death as he had wished. Another similar piece by him would be the Contredanse in G-flat major.

An ambitious goal, indeed, and one that is both complex and cannot be tackled by any one organization alone. That's why, in 2012, The Global Poverty Project decided to host a major benefit concert, Global Citizen Festival, on the Great Lawn in New York's Central Park.  The purpose of the event was to bring together thousands to spark a global movement for change.  

Working together on this once in a lifetime event, The Global Poverty Project and Eventbrite were able to: 
Create a unique lottery system that would distribute free tickets based on a set of actions performed online by members of the global community
Design complex gateways and shoots to manage line ingress and ensure proper security across four festival check in gates within Central Park
Provide reliable, efficient entry for more than 60,000 fans within a few short hours
Offer cutting edge social media integration that made it easy for fans to share their excitement and encourage engagement

Trivia : Tchaikovsky himself didn't give the name ""Патетическая (Patetičeskaja),Pathétique"" to his symphony No.6.
and so far as  No one understand his symphony No.6 
Since his first performance of No.6.
Tchaikovsky gave us the opportunity 
to make the interpretation of No.6 freely...I Think~
Thus Don't stick to the Name ""Pathetique"" and The Movements~

Good day! How are you? :-)
This is the third video in a series I am doing where I edit videos for some of my original music. This time I made a nature video for ""Drøm"" (in English: ""Dream"") which is a relaxing Celtic piece I composed a few months ago. Here's the previous video in the series (""Call From The Past"") ►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lXOLMr2vbs&list=UUIIzc3b8U0_vtVScDEyFGew

I would love to hear your thoughts! I also appreciate sharing and leaving a ""thumbs up"" if you enjoyed it. 

Have a great Friday! :-)

Lyrics:

Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)


You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you""",36980,267,0,1,973303,2014-02-26 13:25:58,1,"let me love you, Mariovevo, how do i breathe, break up, vevo, acoustic, music, video, Let Me Love You live, Mario lyrics, hd, Mario live, Mario Let Me Love You, Turning Point, thinkin about you, official, r and b, download, soul, Mario, pop, remix, somebody else, braid my hair, lyrics, Let Me Love You lyrics, official video, cover, original, Sony, Vevo, how could you, music video, single, just a friend, album, live, Let, Me, Love, You",Mario - Let Me Love You,H64QG4UsrGI,174809329,CJADEAA,b,0,14,2,26,57,2,8.242564605787578,4.413886252329603,5.988248061998041,4.5679669068231545,8,9,0.4001322751322751,184,0.3212662337662337,40,0.5,5,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,23,0.726503017979786,0.5354991393370895,1.3109219449583616,0,0,3.0

Lyrics:

I thought, I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn""",19807,246,0,1,648097,2009-10-03 04:36:16,1,"Natalie Imbruglia, want, NatalieImbrugliavevo, shiver, torn, acoustic, video, Natalie Imbruglia Torn Official, hq, music, single, vocal, album, Torn, instrumental, Left of the Middle, vevo, pop, Natalie Imbruglia Official, big mistakeNatalie Imbruglia Torn, official, download, karaoke, remix, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, smoke, Natalie Imbruglia Lyrics, Sony, music video, hqnatalieimbrugliavevo, Natalie Imbruglia Torn Lyrics, wrong",Natalie Imbruglia - Torn (Official Video),VV1XWJN3nJo,146186645,CJADEAA,b,0,9,10,3,276,5,8.164907699107959,4.496001978701399,5.81164001113613,4.296818701580489,8,40,0.2008333333333333,191,-0.11428571428571427,34,0.0,5,0,4,1,1,1,2,2,1,0,5,0,0,3,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,41,0.7117826955681409,0.5506494554975312,1.352544851147303,1,0,3.0

Lyrics:

Dance, boogie wonderland.
Ha, ha, dance
Boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,'Baby, uh, uh, it don't work'
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance
Boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying

Lyrics:

She'll only come out at nights
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sittin' with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think
You're gettin' for free
The woman is wild
A she-cat tamed
By the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

A scary, creepy Halloween piece on piano. After I played the piano part I added eerie sound effects. Hope you enjoy this scary and suspenseful piano piece (suspense music). I always enjoy composing horror music so I wanted to try to make a new version of my piece ""Darkness"" (this is called ""Darkness - New Version"").

We're approaching Halloween and I thought that it was time for another scary music piece (it's been a long time since I last uploaded scary music!). I composed this horror piece featuring mainly an electric piano. I think electric pianos have a gorgeous sound that can be used in many different settings. I also used my voice in this piece to create some scary sound effects and to make an ominous and eerie atmosphere. 

Hope you enjoy the music! Would love to hear your thoughts. Have a fantastic week and I'll see you soon again! :-)

Is club music allowed to be melancholy once in awhile? Absolutely, it even has to be. At least when the French alternative-pop-folk superstars Nili Hadida and Benjamin Cotto, alias Lilly Wood & The Prick, have their way. Their haunting melody ""Prayer in C"" was quickly snatched up by the DJ, producer and label owner Robin Schulz from Osnabruck, Germany, and sublimated into a shining dancefloor pearl!

At the beginning of this year the head of Lausbuben Records (""Rascal"" Records) and star DJ Robin Schulz already entered the Top 40 of the German iTunes charts with his single ""Sunset"". Last March he shoved none less than Pharrell Williams from the charts throne with his ""Waves"" remix for the Dutch rapper Mr. Probz and took a cosy position at Number One in the German singles, iTunes, airplay and dance hitparade charts. But this is not all because Robin Schulz is more than successful on an international level.  The ""Waves"" remix stayed at #24 in the global iTunes Single Charts, at #21 in the global Spotify Charts and has held a Top 10 position in the Beatport Charts for more than three months. Following acclaimed live appearances in Germany, Holland, France and the UK, the Soundcloud-plays millionaire reached into his electronic bag of tricks and delivers a preview for the upcoming summer holidays with his deep house style remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick's ""Prayer in C"".

It's a superstar collaboration: ""Prayer in C"" is the acoustic counterpart to an open air summer party night in the Provence: the scent of lavender in the air and an atmosphere somewhere between melancholy and euphoria. The track is driven by the absolutely captivating, goose-bump-inducing voice of Nili Hadidas, who with her sexy-smoky timbre, the haunting lyrics as well as Benjamin Cotto's wistful acoustic guitar melody create the organic vibe. The Robin Schulz remix underlays the track with a tight straight-on beat that transforms the original folk-pop track into an energic. melody-house club hymn. And Schulz must know how to do it: nearly 113,000 Soundcloud followers, who clicked his tracks several million times altogether, can't be wrong (for example, ""Willst Du"" has more than 1.2 million clicks or ""Sunset"" more than 820,000). And also his YouTube videos for his bootlegs with millions of clicks show that Robin Schulz knows how to seize the latest sound and serve it up to the masses in a sizzling new package. At the moment Robin Schulz is experiencing the hottest clubs in Europe on an extending tour. And the original creators of the track, the Paris duo Lilly Wood & The Prick don't have to play themselves down as far as fame is concerned. At home in France, the duo advanced to genuine superstars following their double-platinum debut abum. At the beginning of the year, one album track, ""Into Trouble"" was used in a TV spot for the noble jewelry brand Cartier. Together with Robin Schulz they deliver the next club diamond with ""Prayer in C (Robin Schulz Remix)"".

Lyrics

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect

I don't deserve this

Lyrics: 

I wanna feel the same now
I wanna feel the same as when you stood next to me
Stood next to me
There was a time I knew how
There was a time I knew how sweet your kiss could be
Your kiss could be
I remember every smile
Every little smile and every ride just with you 
Ride just with You
If you stay a little while
I will find the place just for me and you 
Trust me, it’s true

Maybe you can‘t understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

Baby please understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland
Go where we want to be
When we get there at night
Let’s stay there for a week
Just wanna feel so close to you

I wanna see that girl now
I wanna see the girl I saw on the crowded street 
On the crowded street 
There was a time you knew how 
There was a time you knew how to make my life complete
Make my life complete
Still remember every smile
Every little smile and every ride just with you 
Ride just with You
If you stay a little while
I will find the place just for me and you  
Trust me, it’s true

Maybe you can‘t understand
Slow down a bit for me
Take me to wonderland

Don See’ is Pardon C’s wake up call to Nigerian government, narrating the current hardship the masses are going through in the country.

time I listen and watch the news, the stories they relay about Nigeria are mostly unpalatable ones, I can’t stop wondering how Nigeria lost its path to greatness to become a struggling country,” Pardon C said.

E non c'è mai una fine (Francesco Silvestre)

Cercare scuse per odiarsi
E per non cedere ai ricordi
Ma non riuscire mai a perdersi
Per noi non valgono i discorsi
Che il tempo aiuta a non pensarci
Perché noi siamo diversi
Tutti e due sappiamo bene che

Che non c’è mai una fine
E che mi fai morire
Stringimi pure amore
Stringimi forte e non sentirò
Più niente ma solo il tuo cuore
E dimmi che hai capito pure te
Che non c’è mai una fine

La sensazione di sentirsi
Un corpo solo e di toccarsi
Solo scambiandoci sguardi
Nel segno di tutti quei graffi
Così profondi e sempre aperti
È la dimostrazione che di star lontani
E di scappare senza ritornare proprio non si può 

E non c’è mai una fine
E poi mi fai morire
Stringimi pure amore
Stringimi forte e non sentirò
Più niente ma solo il tuo cuore
Spogliati e non parlare
Convinci pure il sole che
Che ci potrà bruciare
E che la pioggia non bagnerà 
Anche se arriva un temporale

E non c’è mai una fine
E poi mi fai morire
Stringimi forte amore
Stringimi forte e non sentirò
Più niente ma solo il tuo cuore
E dimmi che hai capito pure te
Che non c’è mai una fine

Luis Armando Lozada Cruz más conocido como Vico C (nacido el 8 de septiembre del 1971 en Brooklyn) es un cantante de rap y reggaetón puertorriqueño.

No solo es considerado un ícono en Puerto Rico, sino en Latinoamérica.

Su nombre artístico se debe a que tenía una vecina llamada Doña Vica la cual era muy seria, y Luis Armando de niño tenía una cara tan seria que se parecía a Vica, y por ello sus amigos comenzaron a asociarlo con la señora llamándolo ""Vico"". La ""C"" viene por una muchacha que le iba a hacer una camiseta que llevara su nombre bordado y le propuso agregarle una gran ""C"" (pronunciado en Inglés: 'si') para que sonara mejor.

The harmonica is used in nearly every type of music, from blues and jazz to country and rock. In this video, music teacher Marcus Milius teaches you how to play the harmonica in the key of C.

Hi, my name is Marcus Milius. I play harmonica. I got a degree at the University of Southern California, a Bachelor's of Music, in Jazz Studies - Chromatic Harmonica. I play and teach harmonica here in New York City, and I'm happy to show you what I do. So playing the harmonica in the key of C is really simple when you're playing the diatonic harmonic. Because it's a diatonic harmonica it's set up in one key. So simply you need a diatonic harmonica in the key of C. If you just pick up the harmonica and just play anywhere you will be playing in the key of C. Whether you're playing chords or single notes - anywhere you play on the harmonica, you'll be in the key of C. The only thing you need to make sure is that whatever component you use, that that's in the key of C as well. So if you're playing along to a recording, you want to find out the key of that recording and make sure it's in the key of C. If you use the wrong key harmonica, you will not be in the key of C. There are ways to do that, but typically the harmonica is setup to play in one key. That is called playing in first position, also known as straight harp - and done by artists like Bob Dylan and it's a very cordial kind of style. However, you can play in all twelve keys on a C harmonica. It just becomes more difficult. The easiest key would be first position, and then second position, third position - twelve different positions, because there are twelve different keys. So, you could technically play in the key of C on any other tuned harmonica like an A harmonica or a G harmonica or an F harmonica. But it becomes a little more difficult. You have to choose your notes and use advanced techniques like bending and over-blowing to make sure you stay in the scale. A little harmonica in C major in first position. You can play single notes, or chords - anything works anywhere on the harmonica. And if you played with chords.",31,194,0,1,242,2011-05-11 16:34:23,0,"Howcast, harmonica, harmonica blues, play harmonica, harmonica lessons, harmonica beginners, learn to play harmonica",How to Play in the Key of C | Harmonica 101,nAlWvKNLOJQ,71418,CMgBEAA,c,0,11,5,11,131,2,4.853807683981579,1.3010299956639813,2.383815365980431,1.4913616938342726,4,19,0.08039469034366993,409,0.0,6,0.0,10,0,3,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,2,4,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,43,0.4911227475796873,0.2680431694806553,1.5984153112124466,0,0,3.0

E a pensarci, che pazzia
è una favola, è solo fantasia
e chi è saggio, chi è maturo lo sa
non può esistere nella realtà!....

Son d'accordo con voi
non esiste una terra
dove non ci son santi né eroi
e se non ci son ladri
se non c'è mai la guerra
forse è proprio l'isola
che non c'è.... che non c'è!...

E non è un'invenzione
e neanche un gioco di parole
se ci credi ti basta perché
poi la strada la trovi da te...

Son d'accordo con voi
niente ladri e gendarmi
ma che razza di isola è?
Niente odio e violenza
né soldati né armi
forse è proprio l'isola
che non c'è.... che non c'è!

Seconda stella a destra
questo è il cammino
e poi dritto, fino al mattino
poi la strada la trovi da te
porta all'isola che non c'è.

... E ti prendono in giro
se continui a cercarla
ma non darti per vinto perché
chi ci ha già rinunciato
e ti ride alle spalle

Lyric:

Mis días no van bien ahora me siento triste 
mi corazón no entiende de tiempos y olvidos
y tiene parches para tapar cicatrices 
por tu amor.

Eh intentado superar tu nombre y no puedo
acepte varias veces perder en tu juego 
solo por mantener prendido nuestro fuego 
y se apago.

Y aunque duela mucho tengo que aceptar
que ya no me quiere, y debo hacerme aparte
no te puedo odiar, mucho menos juzgar 
si tu no me quieres no puedo obligarte.

No no no no puedo olvidarte
no no no me duele nombrarte
porque para mi tu eres lo mas grande 
vivo para amarte, eres importante.

Noches de melancolía, 
eh caminado sin un rumbo fijo y me perdía
me hice preguntas a mi mismo hasta fingí sonrisas
en los momentos que la gente a mi no me entendía.

Yo entiendo que quizás de mi te cansaste
por cierto, tengo la foto que olvidaste 
no entiendo ¿que te falto para quedarte?
mi incendio con tu ego lo propagaste.

Y aunque duela mucho tengo que aceptar
que ya no me quiere, y debo hacerme aparte
no te puedo odiar, mucho menos juzgar 
si tu no me quieres no puedo obligarte.

Vaya a saber con quien te andas dando besos
mientras yo solo enfrento a esta mierda de proceso
ya no progreso, para el pasado regreso 
no haré mas el amor ya solo ofreceré mi sexo.

Y las locuras que por ti hice no las haré jamas
porque jamas se ama dos veces de la misma forma
no importa el tiempo tampoco importa el lugar
si en mis sueños nadie impide que te pueda amar.

Y aunque duela mucho tengo que aceptar
que ya no me quiere, y debo hacerme aparte
no te puedo odiar, mucho menos juzgar 
si tu no me quieres no puedo obligarte.

No no no no puedo olvidarte
no no no me duele nombrarte
porque para mi tu eres lo mas grande

If you're reading this, I have a simple question...

Do you find my work on this channel VALUABLE?

If the answer is yes, wouldn't you say it's worth throwing the creator LESS than what you would spend on a coffee or lose down your sofa cushions?...

In case you don't know, Patreon is a way in which you can support your favourite creators directly with a monthly pledge of as little as a dollar or 2. The security and consistency brought about by this type of support can be completely game-changing for small creators like myself.

By becoming an Elevated patron, you'll get awesome rewards like access to exclusive patron-only jam tracks, your name credited in videos and goodies not available to anyone else, so it's far more than just a donation. 

The goal is simply to be able to keep creating awesome music every day for you guys. But like most small creators, for this I’d rely heavily on your support. So if my work on the channel brings any actual value to your life as a guitarist, musician or otherwise, please consider supporting on Patreon! I'd massively appreciate anything you can offer!

DJ and producer Dynoro has grabbed the Tomorrowland classic ""In My Mind"", re-released it and made his very own version of the number. The track has climbed up in all streaming services and spread like wild fire across social networks. One thing is for sure you will definitely be hearing “In My Mind” this year.

Lyrics:

Sunny days seem to hurt the most.
I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
I feel you everywhere I go.
I see your smile, I see your face,
I hear you laughin' in the rain.
I still can't believe you're gone.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore thepages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who'd you be today?

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family,
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue,
I feel like I can talk to you,
An' I know it might sound crazy.

It ain't fair: you died too young,
Like the story that had just begun,
But death tore the pages all away.
God knows how I miss you,
All the hell that I've been through,
Just knowin' no-one could take your place.
An' sometimes I wonder,
Who you'd be today?

Today, today, today.
Today, today, today.

[Instrumental Break]

Sunny days seem to hurt the most.
I wear the pain like a heavy coat.
The only thing that gives me hope,
Is I know I'll see you again some day.

Some day, some day, some day.

If you're reading this, I have a simple question...

Do you find my work on this channel VALUABLE?

If the answer is yes, wouldn't you say it's worth throwing the creator LESS than what you would spend on a coffee or lose down your sofa cushions?...

In case you don't know, Patreon is a way in which you can support your favourite creators directly with a monthly pledge of as little as a dollar or 2. The security and consistency brought about by this type of support can be completely game-changing for small creators like myself.

By becoming an Elevated patron, you'll get awesome rewards like access to exclusive patron-only jam tracks, your name credited in videos and goodies not available to anyone else, so it's far more than just a donation. 

The goal is simply to be able to keep creating awesome music every day for you guys. But like most small creators, for this I’d rely heavily on your support. So if my work on the channel brings any actual value to your life as a guitarist, musician or otherwise, please consider supporting on Patreon! I'd massively appreciate anything you can offer!

สวัสดีครับท่านผู้ชมขอต้อนรับสู่ Island
อยากมีแฟน There's a chance
ในดินแดนมหัศจรรย์

ดวงตะวันไม่เคยดับทำยังไงก็นอนไม่หลับ
อยากมีแฟน There is a chance in love island
In this little love island
ในดินแดนที่เรียกว่า Love island

เธอนั้น Sexy

เอวเธอ เล็กดี
หุ่นเธอเป๊ะดี ขอลองเช็คที
บอก เอวมาเอวมาเอวมา

ไม่รู้ว่าตาฝาดหรือต้อง Enjoy
โชคชะตาพามาเป็น Sex toy
มองไปตรงไหนฉันก็ตาลอย
อยู่บน เกาะนี่ฉันก็เพลย์บอย
ตื่นขึ้นมาฉัน ก็ จะสุโค่ย
ฉันคงติดใจความสุขเล็กน้อย
Oh ฉัน นั้น ดีใจเวลาดำน้ำกับ girls

นางฟ้าก็เดินเข้ามาตัวฉันแค่อยากสบตา
ดวงดาวและจันทราเรืองแสงที่มัน แสบตา
ดินเนอร์ที่รู้หรา กินหอยกินปูกินปลา
โต้คลื่นจนขาชา จนเห็นโลมาสีชมพู

In this little love island
ในดินแดนที่เรียกว่า Love island

เมื่อช่วงเวลาที่คลื่นทะเลซัดเข้าปะการัง
ทะเลมีปลาในป่ามีเขาบนเกาะนี้แค่เรา มัวและเมา
ดูสิ เธอคนนู้นก็เมา เอ๊ะ เธอคนนี้ก็เมา เอ๊ะ
But don't think to Deep Just bring da Meat
พวกเราแค่เมารักกันเอง
Cuz We eat n Sleep Our Job to Keep
ให้คนรักกันได้ครื้นเครง
ถ้าคุณอกหักก็ลองมา ที่ Love Island ต้องลองมา
ล่องมาด้วยเรือหรือจะเป็นแพ ขอให้คุณถึงก็แล้วกัน Yeah

ใน Island หากคุณอยากมีแฟน
ไม่ต้องนั่งเซ็งเพราะสาวๆ เดินมาหา อุ้ว
ใน Island หากคุณเดินควงแขน
ไม่ต้องกังวลไม่มีใครมาถือสา
What could it be หากว่าคุณไม่มั่นใจ
รักที่แล้วๆ ที่ผ่านมา ไม่ค่อยดี ไม่ค่อยดี วุ๊
ก็ลองมาที่ Love island

credimi io non ci penso mai. 
Vedo che hai pianto 
tu lo sapevi ma da quando? 
Bella d'estate vai via da me... 
Notte d'incanto 
è bello vedere le luci laggiù 
io sono stanco 
non voglio parlare... parla tu... 
bella d'estate vai via da me... 

Forse perché ti credevo felice così... 
proprio così fra le mie braccia... 
forse perché ci bastava arrivare fin qui 
come onde di notte sulla spiaggia... 
La la la la la 
La la la la la 

Piccoli fuochi, 
noi siamo zingari di periferia... 
i nostri son giochi 
che durano poco 
e la notte se li porta via... 
bella d'estate vai via da me... 

Forse perché ti credevo felice così... 
proprio così fra le mie braccia... 
forse perché ci bastava arrivare fin qui 
come onde di notte sulla spiaggia... 
La la la la la 
La la la la la 
Chiudi gli occhi e ti senti per sempre così...

Lyrics:
Final lap I'm on top of the world
And I will never rest for second again
One more time I have beaten them out
The scent of gasoline announces the end

They all said I'd best give it up
What a fool, to believe their lie-ie-ies!
Now they've fallen, I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die-ie-ie?

I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive... the top?

One more turn and I'll settle the score
A rubber fire screams into the night
Crash and burn is what you're gonna do
I am a master of the asphalt fight

They all said I'd best give it up
What a fool, to believe their lie-ie-ies!
Now they've fallen, I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die-ie-ie?

I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!

From Wikipedia: 
""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing (In Perfect Harmony)"" is a pop song which originated as a jingle in the groundbreaking 1971 ""Hilltop"" television commercial for Coca-Cola. The song, produced by Billy Davis and performed by The New Seekers, portrayed a positive message of hope and love sung by a multicultural collection of teenagers on the top of a hill. It originally included the line ""I'd like to buy the world a Coke"" and repeated ""It's the real thing"" as Coca-Cola's marketing theme at the time. It was so popular it was re-recorded by The New Seekers and by The Hillside Singers as a full-length song, dropping references to Coca-Cola, and became a hit record. The version by The New Seekers reached #1 in the U.K. and #7 in the United States. The Hillside Singers' version was released as a successful single the same year; it reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,201,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Symphony No. 38 in D major, K. 504, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in late 1786. It was premiered in Prague on January 19, 1787, a few weeks after Le nozze di Figaro opened there. It is popularly known as the Prague Symphony. Mozart's autograph thematic catalogue bears December 6, 1786, as the date of composition. Other works written by Mozart about contemporary with this symphony include the twenty-fifth piano concerto and the piano trio in B-flat (K. 503 and K. 502, respectively) the former also written in December 1786, the latter written in November. The aria scena and rondo Ch'io mi scordi di te? K.505 for soprano and orchestra with piano obligato, regarded by Girdlestone in his book on Mozart and his Piano Concertos as a work on the same level, also dates from the same period. This work would be called No. 37 if the K. 444 work (mostly by Michael Haydn, except for the slow introduction, which is by Mozart) was removed from the numbering. The early classical symphony of the 18th century would either have three movements or four (or one movement in three recognizable sections, like the 26th or the 32nd), the four-movement symphonies having a minuet in addition. By the time Mozart wrote his Prague symphony, however, the symphony was no longer a step away from the opera overture, no longer bound to this tradition, so that the symphony without a minuet could be, and was, similar in weight to his other symphonies, different mostly in the lack of that minuet and not in overall specific gravity. The Prague Symphony was scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The work has the following three movements:
1. Adagio—Allegro, 4/4 (Sonata form)
2. Andante in G major, 6/8 (Sonata form)
3. Finale (Presto), 2/4.
Although Mozart's popularity among the Viennese waxed and waned, he was consistently popular among the Bohemians and had a devoted following in Prague. A piece appearing in the Prager Neue Zeitung shortly after Mozart's death expresses this sentiment: ""Mozart seems to have written for the people of Bohemia, his music is understood nowhere better than in Prague, and even in the countryside it is widely loved."" The Prague Symphony was written in gratitude for their high esteem.

My own transcription of one of J.S. Bach's most infamous and popular works. I first had the idea of playing this piece in 2013 after hearing an old Russian transcription performed by the incredible Vavara Ivanova, but couldn't get hold of that version due to it being out of print. I loved the power this piece brings to the harp and was determined to try it for myself as I'm a huge fan of anything where I get to play LOUD! The process of adapting the piece for the harp and preparing for this performance took 18 months and many, many practice hours! Its first public performance was as the opening piece of my Masters final recital at the Royal Academy of Music, London in July 2014. Yes I know, how crazy was I to open my recital with this...I then had to play for a further 35 minutes!

All notes in this transcription are Bach's - there are a few moments where certain notes have been omitted where it was impossible to play, but nothing has been added or embellished in terms of pitches or rhythms. My aim in transcribing this was to be as accurate and respectful to the original as I possibly could, whilst also exploring the greater dynamic possibilities with regards to quiets, crescendos and diminuendos that are possible on the harp. I absolutely loved recreating the sound of different manuals/stops in certain repeated passages of the fugue - this is achieved by playing lower in the strings before returning back to the middle where I'd normally play.",1778,573,0,1,104182,2015-02-22 00:24:14,0,"Classical Music (Musical Genre), Harp (Musical Instrument), Johann Sebastian Bach (Composer), Organ (Musical Instrument), Baroque Music (Musical Genre), Transcription (Composition Type), Toccata And Fugue In D Minor BWV 565 (Award-Winning Work), Amy Turk, Toccata (Composition Type), Arrangement","J.S.

In the early days of August 1798, the British Admiral Lord Nelson engaged Napoleon's fleet at Aboukir Bay, near the mouth of the Nile River. Nelson's victory in what became known as the Battle of the Nile was a major breakthrough in the battle against the French. News of it traveled quickly, and Nelson became a celebrated hero.

Back at the Esterházy court, Franz Josef Haydn was putting the finishing touches to his Mass in D minor, the third of six masses he wrote over the years 1796 to 1802 to commemorate the nameday of Princess Marie Hermenegild, the wife of his patron Prince Nikolaus II Esterházy. Haydn had already taken note of the war against Napoleon in his Mass in Time of War (1796), and there are likewise allusions to the fighting in the Mass in D minor -- Haydn's only mass in a minor key -- whose original title, ""Missa in angustiis"", can be translated as Mass in Time of Difficulty or Anxiety. The news of Nelson's victory had probably reached Esterháza by the time of the first performance of the mass, under Haydn's direction, on 23 September 1798; in September 1800, Admiral Nelson himself visited Eisenstadt on his return trip to London. While there, he heard a performance of the D minor Mass, which by that point was firmly associated with him -- hence the nickname which has come down to us.

- The atmosphere of war is evident in the opening Kyrie, especially the harshness of its trumpet and timpani fanfares. 
- The celebratory Gloria that follows evokes the figure of Handel, with whose music Haydn had become well acquainted during his years in London earlier in the 1790s. 
- A lovely, peaceful Qui tollis is at the heart of the Gloria, in which the bass soloist is supported by the chorus and gentle decoration from the organ (probably played by Haydn himself at the work's premiere). 
- The Credo begins traditionally with an old church melody sung polyphonically by the chorus. Then it moves into a ravishing Et incarnatus for the soprano soloist, the usual darkening of mood as the text refers to the Crucifixion, and lastly a brightening of spirit at the Et resurrexit. 
- A brief, restrained Sanctus follows. 
- The portentous Benedictus dominates the second half of the mass; the anger of the hammering of the trumpets and timpani towards its end is one of the fiercest passages in all of Haydn's music. 
- The mood changes with a sweetly flowing Agnus Dei for the vocal soloists, and the chorus takes over for the rousing Dona Nobis Pacem which concludes the work.",84,2311,0,0,1054,2015-10-05 19:38:40,0,,"Joseph Haydn - Mass No. 11 in D minor, ""Nelson Mass""",7EiefC0eesc,268183,CKwCEAA,d,0,15,10,5,278,0,5.428431244655812,2.0293837776852097,3.022840610876528,1.9242792860618816,5,41,0.040990028490028495,515,0.0,0,-0.05,10,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,4,4,1,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,52,0.5568534397211824,0.3738435076769371,1.5708949489670485,0,0,3.0

Que eu te amo muita gente sabe
Já dei prova em forma de buquê
Quem olha pra mim não vê maldade
Maldade só na hora do prazer

E daí se você é gostosa
Que você sobe e desce na festa
Se você tá virando tequila
Não me interessa

Sabe por que eu não te largo
Cê faz gostoso ainda põe leite condensado
Sabe por que cê não me deixa

Sem segundas intenções
Sem tocar, sem beijar

A gata é uma loucura

O MAPA DO TESOURO

Ninguém é super homem 
Deus não te fez de aço
Não leve em teus ombros 
Além do que Ele te deixou
O mundo é natural 
A carne é mortal
É a realidade pra chegar no ideal

O inimigo luta pra você deixar a cruz 
Sem ela, ele sabe que você negou Jesus 
O peso da tribulação não dá pra comparar 
Com o peso da glória que o céu vai revelar

Não despreze a sua cruz 
Ela tem sua medida, Deus um dia calculou 
Ele conhece a força 
E a fraqueza de um pecador 
O calvário declarou 
Com o sangue de Jesus
Para o mundo o seu valor 
Não despreze a sua cruz 
A renúncia é o braço de equilíbrio pra você 
Hoje você não entende, mas um dia irá saber 
Que as pegadas de Jesus 
São o mapa do tesouro 
Deus tem recompensa pra você

A cruz é a responsabilidade do fiel 
É o domínio sobre a carne 
A ponte para o céu 
Diga sim pra Deus
Não negue o que é Seu

#TBT (Tô bebendo todas)

No boteco sem dinheiro 
É só pra passar vontade 
Comanda vazia não mata saudade
Celular descarregado 
A prova de recaída 
Quero ver ligar com zero de bateria 

Lembrar, até que eu lembro 
Sofrer, até que eu sofro 
Não tem pra onde correr 
Deu vontade de voltar 

De voltar pro boteco de novo 

Hoje é dia de TBT 
Tô bebendo todas e lembrando de você 
Mas chorando aqui só tem o violão 
Cada recordação apago com litrão 

Sofrer assim até que é bão

Bruno e Barretto - Farra, Pinga e Foguete

Hoje eu quero um dia de sossego, eu quero paz
Sentir o cheiro dela, o que eu nem me lembro mais
É tudo que eu planejo, acordar cedo e trabalhar
Pegar o mesmo ônibus, ir pra casa descansar
Mas todo fim de tarde a galera me aciona
Era pra tomar uma, mas de novo deu em zona

As luzes tão piscando
Jukebox tocando Amado Batista
E o pau tá quebrando
Ir trabalhar amanhã é o cacete
Hoje é só farra, pinga e foguete

Zé Felipe - My Baby

Hello, my baby
Tô te ligando
Para poder convidar

Vamos sair 
Pra tomar uma lá no bar
Afogar as mágoas
E depois se embriagar

Sim, e depois?

Ah, sei lá
Uma suíte para poder relaxar
Cama redonda para poder namorar
Porque essa noite vai ser nossa

Tá, mas primeiro

Me leve para dançar
Me chame para namorar
Sacode o meu corpo saliente

Me leve para dançar
Me chame para namorar
Serei o seu amor eternamente.

Hoje é a sexta
Mais estranha da minha vida
Já passou das 8
E eu nem toquei em bebida

Eu mudei de celular
Pro passado não me achar
Da balada
Tirei meu nome da lista
Eu achei sem procurar
Viciei só de provar
No coração
Pendurei uma plaquinha
Que dizia:

Quem pegou, pegou, pegou
Não pega mais!
Quem beijou, beijou, beijou
Não beija mais!
Tem um amor de balada
Virando amor da minha vida
Quem diria

Quem pegou, pegou, pegou
Não pega mais!
Quem beijou, beijou, beijou
Não beija mais!
Tem um amor de balada
Virando amor da minha vida
Quem diria
Que eu beijaria
A mesma boca todo dia!

Letra:
[MC Davi]
Olha o que você falou
Esses dias assim, eu não quero mais
Esse é o nosso fim
Que você só quer sair, quer aproveitar
Solteira e ser feliz, beber com as amigas
Sinto que tu se arrependeu, assunto quer puxar
O amor não venceu, eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar
Eu vou me afastar

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Que eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Não volte atrás, não volte atrás
Eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se perdeu

[Gaab]
Olha o que você falou, depois que acabou meu amor
Depois de decratar o nosso fim
Depois de meter mó marra, depois de jogar na minha cara
Eu te fiz tudo e foi nada, você ta forçando a barra
Toma duas dozinha, fica louquinha
Quer beijar minha boca, sai dessa brisa assadinha
Para de graça coloca a roupa

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não ligue mais
Que eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais, pedindo mais (yeeh)
Você se fodeu se vim pedindo mais
Pedindo mais (yeeh)

[Cynthia Luz]
Eu vi a cena toda, olhei pra sua cara
Senti uma coisa boa, mas to saindo fora
Tem beijo que se gruda não solta
Eu vou deixar meu corpo suar
Perdemos tempo e eu não quero que pense eu vou voltar
O melhor de mim se teve né?, o meu sorrisinho tão leve (é)
Você gosta de mentir pra mim, mas eu já to longe da sua

Então me faça um favor, quando você for
Apague meu número, não me ligue mais
Eu vou tocar o terror, me negaram amor
Eu só vou sorrindo, se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

[Gaab, MC Davi e Cynthia Luz]

Pedindo mais, pedindo mais
Se fodeu se vim pedindo mais

(Interprete : Baviera)
Menina me da sua mão, pense bem antes de agir
Se não for agora, te espero lá fora, então deixe-me ir
Um dia te encontro nessas suas voltas
Minha mente é mó confusão 
Solta a minha mão que eu sei que cê volta
O tempo mostra nossa direção 

Se eu soubesse que era assim eu nem vinha
Tô bebendo champanhe e catando latinha
Mas tive que perder pra aprender dar valor 
Pra você entender seu amor, mas não quer ser mais minha 
Então diz que não me quer por perto
Mas diz olhando nos meus olhos 
Desculpe se eu não fui sincero 
Mas a vida que eu levo, erros lógicos 
Óbvio, cada letra em rap é um código sórdido 
Psicografado som sólido, súbito
Nunca fui de fazer som pra público
Verso meu universo, peço que entenda meu mundo mina
A gente briga por bobeira demais 
A gente pira o tempo vira por bobeira demais 
O amor é a bandeira de paz
Mas se não der vai em paz, meto o pé 
Tô vivo e quero viver, ensinar e aprender 
Menina eu sigo com ou sem você, mas tente entender
Eu tentei, a vida é curta pra chorar pela ex
Eu falei pra mim mesmo enquanto eu chorava outra vez

Eu vou ficar, mas vou pela manhã 
Sem me despedir, vou antes do café 
Que é pra não te acordar, sei que não sou nenhum Don Juan 
Sou todo errado, mas tô certo que você me quer

(Interprete : Knust)
Ei, amor, sei que tá tão difícil eu falar de amor
Porque lá fora é tanto ódio e rancor
Que eu preciso muito te falar
Ei amor, eu tô contigo independente do caô
Cê sabe que aonde você for eu vou
E já passou da hora da gente se encontrar
E se amar, nega, cê sabe que contigo nada vai me abalar
A viagem é longa então faça a mala
Na vibe mais positiva, no pique mandala
Esse papo de que se tu não existisse eu te inventaria é tão clichê
Mas cai tão bem quando se trata de você
Só vem comigo, cê não vai se arrepender
Só vem comigo, cê não vai se arrepender

( Interprete : Pablo)
Noites em claro, tentando não me envolver, 
Seja o que Deus quiser
Noites em claro, tentando não me envolver
Seja o que Deus quiser, deixe-me ir
Não vou me despedir porque dói
Não vou brigar pra ficar
Quero estar contigo e sentir, ser seu e só
Sem ter que justificar o tempo em que eu sumi
Seja o que Deus quiser, deixe-me ir

LETRA:

Quem diria que fosse chegar nesse ponto
Me fala eu tô pronto
Tô querendo saber
É melhor pra você

Não precisa me preservar
Não vou me assustar
Prometeu que ia se conter
Eu falei que pagava pra ver

Mentiu pra amigas
Falou que não ia dançar
Mas a sua promessa
O grave bateu pra quebrar

E quando ela escuta o grave
Ela desce suave
Desce suave
Toda sem maldade
Ela desce suave
Tem habilidade
Ela desce suave
Desce suave
Que maravilha
É só bunda pra baixo
Bunda pra cima
Olha essa menina
Toda empinadinha
É só bunda pra baixo
Bunda pra cima

Ela joga na cara
Joga na cara
Joga na cara
E já tá preparada
Ela joga na cara
Toda abusada
E na arte da dança
Ela já é treinada

E quando viu 
Já tava rebolando
As mãozinhas pra cima jogando
E o ritmo te controlando

Descendo, causando
Remexendo, rebolando

Mais amor e menos drama
Né? Né melhor? Eu acho!
Faz tão pouco tempo que provei teu beijo
Gostei, mas eu não nego que eu tô com medo
Vai que acontece como dá última vez
Me entrego, te amo, cê foge, sobrei

Quando eu tento ir devagar
Daí cê vem pra cima
Basta uma mensagem
E olha você virando a esquina

Na minha intimidade
Você foi entrando
Meus pais já te aprovaram
E a gente tá só ficando

Mas antes de te entregar meu coração
Eu preciso saber da sua intenção
Se é só fogo de palha, qualquer boca apaga
Se for por aí a gente para

Mas antes de te entregar meu coração
Eu preciso saber da sua intenção

Letra da música:
Gaab
Você já sabe qual é 
Quando você ver o meu sinal 
Ta na hora de meter o pé 
Pra minha casa e não é pra ir tomar café
Você já sabe qual é 
É só ir seguindo a marginal 
Passa no shopping tatuapé
Ja tá em casa e não é pra ir tomar café

Tem café 
Mas prefiro um chá que é pra relaxar
E deixar louca (4x)

É tão gostoso quando você fica louca 
Fica assanhada fica toda solta
Não faz gracinha pra tirar roupa 
Quer vir por cima e comandar a porra toda

E por mim pode continuar 
E por mim não tem que parar
Se é o que cê quer fazer então faça
Seguir todas regras deixa a vida sem graça

Eu não sei quem inventou a vodka
Mas que invenção de outro patamar
Faço coisas que eu não faria
Por causa da hipocrisia eu não teria historia pra contar
Quando eu te vi eu tava bem loco
Pra te agarrar faltava bem pouco
Chá, docinho, whisky e água de coco
A poção de êxtase pro seu corpo

MC Hariel
Tática ágil de persuasão 
Mete o louco em quem tá no seu pé 
E vem pra minha casa 
La você já sabe como é

Tem café 
Mas prefiro um chá que é pra relaxar
E deixar louca (4x)

Quando eu transo com o teto vira chão 
E a lei do retorno vira lei da atração 
Então me diz porque não 
Hablas comigo 
Morena caliente sua
Buceta e um perigo 
Então me diz porque não 
Fica mais um pouquinho 
Eu vim pela engenheiro toda 
Pensando em fuder contigo 
Camarote, lista VIP, open bar, camarim 
Mais nada disso importa se eu tiver sozinho
Então participa em uma parte da minha vida 
Em troca eu te do um pedacinho 
Da minha pika 
E não complica que eu não entro em bola dividida 
E se eu entrar e pra desempatar a partida 
Não quero saber aonde você tá 
Nem me interessa com quem você tá

Marcos e Belutti - Mais Um Ano Juntos

Composta por Jairinho Delgado 

Amar alguém é fácil quando vai tudo bem
Difícil é ficar quando os problemas vem
Nem tudo é mar de rosas, entendemos do assunto
Pois olha nós aqui comemorando mais um ano juntos

Parabéns pra nós, amor
Eu passei no jardim
E te trouxe essa flor
Na falta de champanhe
Tem suco de laranja
E esse bolinho de chocolate
Que eu sei que você ama

Eu quero renovar os votos e dizer
Que na riqueza ou na pobreza
Eu quero só você, dinheiro vai e vem
O amor que a gente tem
Supera falta dele e fica tudo bem

Casal em crise de grana e não de amor
Vai melhorar, não chora por favor
Um brinde a nós dois a intuição me diz
Que ano que vem a gente comemora
Essa data em Paris

Parabéns pra o nosso amor
Eu passei no jardim
E te trouxe essa flor
Na falta de champanhe
Tem suco de laranja
E esse bolinho de chocolate
Que eu sei que você ama

Eu quero renovar os votos e dizer
Que na riqueza ou na pobreza
Eu quero só você, dinheiro vai e vem
O amor que a gente tem
Supera falta dele e fica tudo bem

Casal em crise de grana e não de amor
Vai melhorar, não chora por favor
Um brinde a nós dois a intuição me diz
Que ano que vem a gente comemora
Essa data em Paris

Tem mais uma coisinha, quase eu me esqueci
Um cartãozinho lindo, nele eu escrevi
Que o meu maior tesouro é seu amor querida
Muito obrigado por você existir na minha vida

E quando eu for bem velhinho eu vou contar
Essa história pros netinhos na sombra de um pomar
Bolo de chocolate, suco de laranja bem frasquinho
Meu plano é envelhecer do seu ladinho

Eu quero renovar os votos e dizer
Que na riqueza ou na pobreza
Eu quero só você, dinheiro vai e vem
O amor que a gente tem
Supera falta dele e fica tudo bem

Casal em crise de grana e não de amor
Vai melhorar, não chora por favor
Um brinde a nós dois a intuição me diz
Que ano que vem a gente comemora
Essa data em Paris

Ô ô, em Paris

João e Maria
Autoria: Chico Buarque

Letra:
De tudo que é nego torto
Do mangue e do cais do porto
Ela já foi namorada
O seu corpo é dos errantes
Dos cegos, dos retirantes
É de quem não tem mais nada

Dá-se assim desde menina
Na garagem, na cantina
Atrás do tanque, no mato
É a rainha dos detentos
Das loucas, dos lazarentos
Dos moleques do internato

E também vai amiúde
Com os velhinhos sem saúde
E as viúvas sem porvir
Ela é um poço de bondade
E é por isso que a cidade
Vive sempre a repetir

Joga pedra na Geni!
Joga pedra na Geni!
Ela é feita pra apanhar!
Ela é boa de cuspir!
Ela dá pra qualquer um!
Maldita Geni!

Um dia surgiu, brilhante
Entre as nuvens, flutuante
Um enorme zepelim
Pairou sobre os edifícios
Abriu dois mil orifícios
Com dois mil canhões assim

A cidade apavorada
Se quedou paralisada
Pronta pra virar geleia
Mas do zepelim gigante
Desceu o seu comandante
Dizendo: ""Mudei de ideia!""

Quando vi nesta cidade
Tanto horror e iniquidade
Resolvi tudo explodir
Mas posso evitar o drama
Se aquela formosa dama
Esta noite me servir

Essa dama era Geni!
Mas não pode ser Geni!
Ela é feita pra apanhar
Ela é boa de cuspir
Ela dá pra qualquer um
Maldita Geni!

Mas de fato, logo ela
Tão coitada e tão singela
Cativara o forasteiro
O guerreiro tão vistoso
Tão temido e poderoso
Era dela, prisioneiro

Acontece que a donzela
(E isso era segredo dela)
Também tinha seus caprichos
E ao deitar com homem tão nobre
Tão cheirando a brilho e a cobre
Preferia amar com os bichos

Ao ouvir tal heresia
A cidade em romaria
Foi beijar a sua mão
O prefeito de joelhos
O bispo de olhos vermelhos
E o banqueiro com um milhão

Vai com ele, vai, Geni!
Vai com ele, vai, Geni!
Você pode nos salvar
Você vai nos redimir
Você dá pra qualquer um
Bendita Geni!

Foram tantos os pedidos
Tão sinceros, tão sentidos
Que ela dominou seu asco
Nessa noite lancinante
Entregou-se a tal amante
Como quem dá-se ao carrasco

Ele fez tanta sujeira
Lambuzou-se a noite inteira
Até ficar saciado
E nem bem amanhecia
Partiu numa nuvem fria
Com seu zepelim prateado

Num suspiro aliviado
Ela se virou de lado
E tentou até sorrir
Mas logo raiou o dia
E a cidade em cantoria
Não deixou ela dormir

Joga pedra na Geni!
Joga bosta na Geni!
Ela é feita pra apanhar!
Ela é boa de cuspir!
Ela dá pra qualquer um!
Maldita Geni!

 Letra Até você voltar - Henrique e Juliano

Aqui sentado nessa mesa
Só o copo de cerveja é minha companhia
E essa casa tá tão cheia
E parece vazia sem você comigo

E hoje está fazendo um ano
Aqui no meu calendário ainda tá marcando o dia e o mês
Foi a primeira vez 
E o que me prometeu, será que se esqueceu?

De todos nossos planos, nosso filho, nosso apartamento
Da nossa lua de mel, do nosso casamento
Como pude acreditar nesse seu juramento?
E agora estou sozinho outra vez

De copo sempre cheio, coração vazio
Tô me tornando um cara solitário e frio
Vai ser difícil eu me apaixonar de novo e a culpa é sua

Antes embriagado do que iludido

Napoli, 19 gennaio 1912 -- Napoli, 13 marzo 2003
The large double--door entrance to via Cimarosa 25 in the Vomero section of Naples was half--closed this morning, as is customary when someone in the household passes away. And—as is customary—a small white card was affixed to the door. It was written by hand and read, succintly, ""For the death of Roberto Murolo"". He was 92. It was, perhaps, the only non--violent thing that could have happened in Naples yesterday to push today's visit to the city by the ex--royal family of Italy, the Savoys, out of the headlines. And it did.  
There are three main reasons why one--thousand miles of Italians—from the Alps to Sicily—know something about the culture and language of Naples. The first reason is the great playwright Eduardo de Filippo, on many a literary critic's ""short list"" of Those Who Should Have Got a Nobel Prize But Didn't."" The second reason—on a more popular (and more vital) level—is Italy's greatest film comic, Antonio de Curtis, known simply as ""Totò"". The third reason is Roberto Murolo, the gentle and erudite chronicler of Neapolitan music and the best--known singer in the twentieth century of the ""Neapolitan Song""  
If Murolo had simply been content to remain a guitarist and singer, he certainly would have done very well, but he was born to more than that. His father was the highly--regarded dialect poet Ernesto Murolo, part of the long tradition of dialect literature that included his own contemporary, Salvatore di Giacomo, and reached back through the 18th--century libretti of the Neapolitan Comic Opera to the 16th--century Pentamarone by Giambattista Basile, and beyond. Thus, Roberto Murolo was very aware of being part of that tradtion, and his great contribution to the music of Naples is a scholarly one. He dedicated years of his life to researching, collecting and documenting Neapolitan music and in 1963 published what amounted to a musical encyclopedia of the music of Naples, a 12 LP set containing songs from 1200 to 1962, all carefully documented and explained and all immaculately sung by Murolo, himself. He sang in the precise pronunciation of a literary language, quite different from the uneducated ""street sound"" that one often associates with the term ""dialect"".  
Murolo is not the reason that Neaplitan songs such as  'o sole mio and Funiculì--Funilulà are known abroad. That goes back to yet an earlier generation, the years at the turn of the century when so many Neapolitans emigrated and took their music with them. Interestingly, however, Murolo was part of the post--WW2 generation of Neapolitan singers who resisted the onslaught of American popular music and helped keep the traditional music of his native culture from becoming passé.  
Although he became less active with advanced age, Murolo never really retired. He took part in the 1993 version of the annual Festival of Italian Popular Music in San Remo with a song entitled ""L'Italia è bella,"" a song against racism and xenophobia. And while ""cross cultural"" music is run of the mill today, Murolo was doing that as long ago as 1974, when he sought out and sang with the great Portughese performer of Fado, Amalia Rodriguez. Murolo was an inspiration to the ""friendly rivals"" of his own generation such as Sergio Bruni and to the younger generation of singers such as Massimo Ranieri and Pino Daniele, both of whom published tributes to Murolo in the paper this morning. As with the passing of Eduardo de Filippo in 1984 and Totò in 1967, there is a very real sense of loss in Naples today.

Played by: Aldona Dvarionaite

Fryderyk Chopin (Polish: Fryderyk [Franciszek] Chopin, sometimes Szopen; French: Frédéric [François] Chopin;March 1, 1810 -- October 17, 1849) was a Polish virtuoso pianist and piano composer of the Romantic period. He is widely regarded as the greatest Polish composer, and one of the most influential composers for piano in the 19th century.

Chopin was a genius of universal appeal. His music conquers the most diverse audiences. When the first notes of Chopin sound through the concert hall there is a happy sigh of recognition. All over the world men and women know his music. They love it. They are moved by it. Yet it is not ""Romantic music"" in the Byronic sense. It does not tell stories or paint pictures. It is expressive and personal, but still a pure art. Even in this abstract atomic age, where emotion is not fashionable, Chopin endures. His music is the universal language of human communication. When I play Chopin I know I speak directly to the hearts of people!

Chopin's music for the piano combined a unique rhythmic sense (particularly his use of rubato), frequent use of chromaticism, and counterpoint. This mixture produces a particularly fragile sound in the melody and the harmony, which are nonetheless underpinned by solid and interesting harmonic techniques. He took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. Three of his twenty-one nocturnes were only published after his death in 1849, contrary to his wishes.He also endowed popular dance forms, such as the Polish mazurka and the waltz, Viennese Waltz, with a greater range of melody and expression. Chopin was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual pieces. Chopin also took the example of Bach's preludes and fugues, transforming the genre in his own preludes.

Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, in the Duchy of Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French-expatriate father and came to be regarded as a child-prodigy pianist. In November 1830, at the age of twenty, Chopin went abroad. After the suppression of the Polish 1830--31 Uprising, he became one of the many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In Paris he made a comfortable living as composer and piano teacher, while giving few public performances. A great Polish patriot, in France he used the French version of his given name and, to avoid having to rely on Imperial Russian documents, eventually became a French citizen.After some ill-fated romantic involvements with Polish ladies, from 1837 to 1847 he conducted a turbulent relationship with the French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). Always in frail health, at 39 in Paris he succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis.

Chopin's extant compositions all include the piano, predominantly alone or as a solo instrument among others. Though his music is technically demanding, its style emphasizes nuance and expressive depth rather than technical virtuosity. Chopin invented new musical forms such as the ballade,and made major innovations to existing forms such as the piano sonata, waltz, nocturne, étude, impromptu, and prelude. His works are mainstays of Romanticism in 19th-century classical music. His mazurkas and polonaises remain the cornerstone of Polish national classical music.

Leggiamo rilievi circa un presunto plagio di Chopin nell'introduzione della canzone ""Ti penso e cambia il mondo"" cantato da Adriano Celentano.
Teniamo a precisare che gli autori della parte musicale della canzone "" Ti penso e cambia il mondo"" sono Stephen J. Lipson e Matteo Saggese, già collaboratori tra gli altri di Celine Dion e dei Rolling Stones, mentre Adriano Celentano ne è l'interprete.
In ogni caso un richiamo a Chopin potrebbe essere una semplice citazione tra l'altro consentita, in quanto si tratterebbe di una composizione di pubblico dominio.

La canzone parla di un dialogo tra un uomo e Dio che lo rassicura circa il suo futuro dopo l'addio ultimo alla vita.  L'impianto armonico della canzone è costruito intorno al Preludio in do minore, opus 28, numero 20 di Fryderyk Chopin

Versuri:

Nu mai exista basme, nici eu nu mai exist
Balaurul e smecher, iar Fat-Frumos e trist
Cu cat urcam in varsta, ne suntem mai straini
Te duci copilarie si devenim haini
Bunica si bunicul cema-nveleau cantand
Sunt doua cruci de piatra si tac pe sub pamant
Si mai era si crangul, si-un rau, si niste tei
Te duci copilarie, pe toate mi le iei

Strofa  1:

Te rog o clipa sa mai stai / Fa o minune sa ma nasc din nou pe 9 Mai
Sa cresc cu mingea in spate la bloc  / Sa fur de prin gradini caise verzi si flori de soc
Sa iubesc prima zapada  / Sa stau cu orele in ger cu sania pe strada
Fa cumva du-ma-napoi la scoala / Sa-mi corup colegii toti sa lasam iar clasa goala
Da-mi din nou vreo 14 ani, / Ca sa m-apuc de rap cu vise-n cap si fara bani
Fa-mi parintii cum au fost  / Tineri si buni, m-au tinut la adapost
Adu-mi povestile de seara / Ce m-adormeau asa frumos ca greierii de-afara
Nu ma trezi in lumea asta ce-i plina de fiare / Copilarie iarta-ma c-am vrut sa fiu om mare


Faceam p-atunci razboaie cu sabii mici de nuc,
Iar dupa batalie, mergeam sa bem un suc.
Azi ne-omoram pe bune prin diferite cai,
Te duci copilarie si devenim mai rai!

Strofa 2:

Mi-atat de dor de sarbatori, / De bradu’ din sufragerie si de colindatori
De-un ceai de tei, hey, de zane si zmei / De flori de gheata ce-mbracau geamul in polei,
Imi lipsesc cartile din dormitor /  Si serile-n familie la televizor
Cel mai frumos parfum venea din cozonaci / Ce iesea din mainile mamei mele dragi!
Mergeam sa luam in fuga guma cu surprize, / Apoi le jucam la carti in cateva reprize
Si nu stiam de bani, rautate, sau nevoi / Copilarie unde fugi, intoarce-te-napoi
Ca m-ai lasat sa cresc, fara sa ma opresc / Si-acum numai in ganduri pot sa copilaresc
Ca-mi vad in oglinda fire albe, primul rid / Te rog da-mi inapoi anii ce s-au dus rapid!

Din tinda casei mele cand mama imi vorbea,
Fugeau din bolta norii si soarele zambea,
Iar tata, orice teama din vis mi-o spulbera
Te duci copilarie cu fericirea mea

Strofa 3:

Copilarie, sinonim cu fericire, / Sinonim cu stralucire, acum doar o amintire
Amintirea orelor pierdute prin cartier / Pe la scari de bloc sau jocuri prin santier (Doar tu) 
Prima dragoste mi-ai dat / Primele emotii, primii fluturi in stomac
Tu la fel de tanara, eu m-am schimbat / Tot cu tine mi-am luat primu’ pumn ce m-a facut barbat
Si mi-ar placea sa stam la masa la o vorba de bine / Sa-mi spui sa mai raman aici sa nu mai fug de tine,

Chord Progression: 

II:     F7            I     Bb7           I    F7              I    Cm7    F7     I 
I     Bb7           I    Bdim7        I    F7              I        D7               I
I     Gm7          I    C7               I    F7   D7     I    Gm7    C7      :II

On the track, you will hear extensions and alterations of the basic chords - as is common in jazz....  :) 


Try these scales: 


F minor pentatonic scale: F Ab Bb C Eb (F)

F minor blues scale: F Ab Bb B C Eb (F)

F major pentatonic scale: F G A C D (F)


Then.... 


F Mixolydian Mode: F G A Bb C D Eb (F)  - F7 chords

F Dorian Mode: F G Ab Bb C D Eb (F) - Bb7 chords

G Harmonic Minor Scale: G A Bb C D Eb F# (G) - D7 Chords

G Dorian Mode: G A Bb C D E F (G) - Gm7 chords 

C Mixolydian Mode: C D E F G A Bb (C) - C7 chords 

G Dorian and C Mixolydian contains the same notes as F Major Scale! 

F Major Scale: F G A Bb C D E (F)


You can also treat the D7 as a D7alt chord and use the D Altered Scale...

D Altered Scale: D Eb F F# Ab Bb C (D) 

D Altered Scale is also known as D Super Locrian - and it's the 7th mode of the Eb Melodic Minor Scale. 


Arpeggios: 


F7 - F A C Eb 

Bb7 - Bb D F Ab 

Cm7 - C Eb G Bb   

Bdim7 - B D F Ab 

D7 - D F# A C  

Gm7 - G Bb D F 

C7 - C E G Bb

Me chamem de Latrell Spencer, o foda
Que deixou esses cara pálida na cadeira de roda
Eu incomodo, porque dizer a verdade incomoda
Flow corrosivo, igual bicarbonato de sódio
Esse é Coruja BC1, zika, filho de pai negão
Que curte reações análise, não  análises de um REAÇÃO
Contra a maré já subi Foz do Iguaçu
E agora toda cena sabe que existe rap em Bauru
A mil na pista igual Range Rover
Enquanto dou risada desses histérico de internet
Playboys que pensam que são Takeover
Então nesse take ouve nas linha eu reencarno Éter
Subo degrau por degrau da escada sem elevador
Elevando o nível do jogo e também da sua própria dor
Nasci, em 94, morô
Pois se fosse em 97 diriam: Pac voltou

[Ponte]
Olhe mais pras rimas por favor
Pois quem só olha pra views é cego
Se pá cês fumaram crack da fama
Tão igual porco na lama tendo overdose de ego
Disseram que eu tava morto pro rap
Levei isso como piada
Esqueceram que eu sou uma ave no rap
Agora esses cuzão tão tudo com medo de alma penada

[Verso 2]
4x4 do flow até pareço um jipe
Analistas do canal turbo chamam de egotrip
Cês reclamam igual o Hardy
Eu sou leão igual Lippy, animal
Divisão noturna me alimento do eclipse, mas
""Coruja não é preto, é branco do cabelo ruim""
Ruim é teu preconceito há mais de 500 ano assim
Te mato sem aço, sem gangue
Com o mic na mão, te mostro a melanina no meu sangue
Com mil convites pra rimar boombap
Calma, família, eu odeio Trump, eu não odeio trap
Meus versos são língua no grelo
Fique pasmo, ainda não percebeu mas o beat tá tendo orgasmo
Adoto fãs que ficaram orfãos de idolos como consolo
Depois eu reencarnei Moisés e chutei o bezerro de ouro
Crianças cês não são Suge Knight
Só porque sugam com canudo o pózinho branco na night
Sem remorso dos flow que disparo pra derruba
Coração duas vezes gelado eu chamo de bipolar
Rapper sendo infantil tá precisando de babá
Mas hoje não no meu pau, então tira sua boca de lá
Preguiçosos iguais Jaiminho, não tem punch no prato
Tão tanga froxa que no CEP eles põe Tangamandapio
Sou Coruja! Nessa, corrida de rato
Muddy Waters sem Chess pra lucrar com o contrato
Sei o que eles quer? O quê?
Bota o rap numa cruz
Mata pra deturpa a história igual Roma fez com Jesus
Que era negro do cabelo crespo igual meus ancestrais
Porém um cristo de olho azul faria a indústria render bem mais
Eu dou unfollow na tua vida, pivete
E o máximo que cê faz é xingar muito na internet
MC que é MC tem que explorar o limite
O ministério do bom senso disse: bebê, não digite

Tô com os pés no chão igual capoerista
Mirando o espaço igual astronauta
Minha auto-estima é equivalente ao dólar
Que até em tempo de crise consegue se manter em alta
Fiz meu álbum visando o futuro
Pra dar de presente pros meus ouvintes
Caso cês não entenda as rima agora
Espera mais 3 anos pois fiz pensando em 2020

[Refrão x17]
Liguei o modo foda-se

[Interlúdio]
Eu não sou rapper, eu sou um MC
Sou um MC
Como prometido

[Verso 3]
Lavei minha mão com álcool e detergente
Amolei o bisturi
Operação perfeita, tirei o Hip-Hop da UTI
Comprei camisinha GG e resurgi
Com os verso que bota no -- do rap game sem cuspir
Eu dei meu duro eles tomaram igual Dreher
Rainha é Erykah Badu
Foda-se Iggy Azalea
Nós com dinheiro é conquista
Eles com dinheiro é mesada
Nós é made in favela
Eles cosplay de quebrada
Chave igual gol quadrado
Atropelo flow saturado
E transformo papéis com escrito
Em papéis com peixe estampado
Fracos, caiu do alto igual folha depois do outono
Fim da Dinastia César, gueto de volta pro trono
Roubo teu sono igual coca ou café de vó
Cês no piano só vem de ré
Eu chego na sola sem dó
Foda-se Thor, eu sou machado de xangô
No dia dos nossos o profeta das ruas voltou

Strofa 1:

N-am avut nimic dat de-a gata asa ca, n-am trait in rai
N-au avut malai mama si tata doar, paine , gem si ceai
Si-am zis ca-ntr-o zi o sa le am pe toate
Ca ravneam la ele cand ma trezeam in noapte
C-aceeasi bluza o purtam indiferent de vreme
Aceleasi ghete Puma din SH cu multe embleme
Stiu cum e sa n-ai, stiu cum doare lipsa
Cand taie lumina si-aduce eclipsa
Stiu cum e sa vrei un un lucru la care visezi
Stiu cum e sa nu-l poti lua, stiu cum e sa-l pierzi
Dar asta m-a facut mai tare , rece ca un scut
Ascult ploaia si tunetu-l ascult
Si mai stiu ca vine ziua ce-o visez de mult
Si-o sa ma bucur cu lacrimi de tot ce n-am avut

Refren:

Strofa 2:

Saracia naste arta, face din golani, poeti
Cand vezi  picturi in igrasia ce iese din pereti
Ma trezeam noaptea si scriam despre ce n-aveam
Ma minteam c-aveam de toate si fals ma bucuram
Zorii lasau ceata rece peste geam 
Si-mi ziceau sa ma trezesc din visul in care traiam
Una calda, 10 reci, cand veneau zile reci
puneam 3 plovere pe mine ca n-aveam bani de geci
La 18 ani baietii cu gologani
Invarteau volanu de mertan se vedeau americani
Aveau tot ce nu aveam ca faceau banii din droguri
Deveniti cunoscuti de toata lumea dintre blocuri
Dar am zis nu nu nu nu nu nu nu
 Mai bine n-ai nimic acum dar esti un  om liber sub stele
Nu nu nu nu nu

Strofa 1

Mă uit în spate mult și văd un puștan
Pasionat de sport și carte și fără niciun dușman,
Da' dacă mă uit puțin mai în față văd un golan
Plin de greață dimineața și cu o foame de bani,
Revin puțin mai în spate că-i mai ok 
Pentru copiii tăi dar mai ales pentru părinții mei
Care pe lângă neînțelegerile lor mi-au oferit 
Tot ce avea nevoie un copil să crească fericit,
Și i-am răsplătit ascultând și învățând
Până când mi-a intrat altceva-n gând..
Și-am fugit pe străzile astea murdare, unde se moare de foame
Mi-aduc aminte aveam doar 14 ani și frica-n picioare 
Strângeam din dinți și spuneam: Doamne, ține-mă tare
Că am plecat și tre' să văd cum fac să am de mâncare 
Știu c-o să fie greu mereu și c-o să apară multe în cale
Da' acum Alex e băiat mare și trage tare!


Strofa 2

Viața mea-i de povestit, altfel nu eram pe beat
Eram plecat ca să-mi fac banii riscând anii cu-n cuțit,
Da' muzica m-a liniștit, de când știu că poți să îți iei venit din hit
Mereu ce scuip e strălucit, n-am vrut în top doar am pășit (cu capu') 
Că aici nu este vorba de noroc, tre' să fii bine pregătit
Iar eu de mic alerg și trag încât simt că m-am depășit
Dar tot nu mă oprește nimic, doar mă-ntărește atunci când pic..
Știu cum e să stai cu gândacii în frig 
Știu că dacă tragi chimi între timp în saci nu bagi nimic,
Știu cum e să stai cu falși i-am citit
Știu că pentru cash se schimbă la chip rapid 
De-asta m-am trezit și-s diferit față de ieri
În orice caz, nici mâine n-o să fiu ca azi și tot așa până la cer,
De aici de jos din cartier, 
Unde trebuie să tragi de tine la fel cum trage și Alex de el.

Refren 

Trag ca la jug ca să bag în portofel
Că-mi țin visul cu chirie în camera de hotel,
Voință de oțel, trag să mai urc un nivel
Să clădesc un imperiu să mut visul în castel.",920,172,0,1,26152,2018-07-28 16:58:19,0,"jianu trag, trag, f charm, jianu, din sudu fierbinte, in linia intai",Jianu feat. F.

You put me through pain, I wanna let you know how I feel

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now

LYRICS : 
Hell yeah comin at you once again, guess who's back?
The one original band in this sanitized scene comes to kill this track

Like Bejita, I come back stronger
And more vicious, Sharp like Shura
Muthafuckin' industry cock sucker, you've sold out you'r wide opened ass
Make me laugh, Make me cry, let you die
When I see what your band wants and tries
I'm of another caliber, all together
Contracts torn to pieces like Mecha-Freezer

Get the fuck off
Mother fucker
Back the fuck off
Fucking hustler
What the fuck? What the fuck?
I don't wanna
I don't need ya
Watch out the fire
Of the Saiya

This first album is a victory, created, composed and paid by ourselves
Dedicaded to all our friends, Supporters and sadly... Our dead ones

You and your fake contracts you don't enslave me
I know what you want from me, what you've got for me
Make money money money on my back
You're funny funny funny let me smash your trap
here is the next concept, respect what we are and fuck the rest
In this business I'm delivery guy
One Team standing under the Koshien sky

Get the fuck off
Mother fucker
Back the fuck off
Fucking hustler
What the fuck? What the fuck?
I don't wanna
I don't need ya
Watch out the fire
Of the Saiya

You'll never tame my flame
This is my last chance
You'll never tame my flame
Untill my last breath
You'll never tame my flame
You'll never tame my flame
You'll never tame my flame
Never forget my name

Put your middle fingers up, they can't stop the great North walk!

O stiu de pe la bloc, fata fara jucarii
I-ar fi luat si ei parintii daca n-aveau datorii
Statea mereu retrasa, rusinoasa ganditoare
Ca sa n-o rada vecinii c-avea hainele murdare
Sa faca una de-un leu nu cersea prin gari
Mai dadea cu maica-sa cu greu cu matura prin scari  
S-ar fi dus mai des la scoala iubea poezia
Dar de unde bani de carti cand e in Romania
A facut 18 ani, exact cat sa-i ajunga
Si-a gasit la un patron un loc mai bun de munca
Pana cand intr-o zi a tras-o de tricou
Ia zis “intra sub birou ca-ti fac salariu cadou”
Cu scaraba l-a privit si cu inima de gheata
A plecat, a trantit usa i-a dat un scuipat in fata
Ea este Cristina de la etajul 6 
A trecut prin scoala vietii si n-a terminat 8 clase

Strofa 2:

Ajunsa pe drumuri iar, viata-i un calvar
Se uita prin vitrine la salam si cascaval
Ca nu visa de ziua ei sa guste sampania
Pleaca cu sperante-n ochi la munca-n Spania
Si-acolo-si face prieteni ce vor s-o ajute
Sa puna rapid  pe dreapta si ea cateva sute 
Dar nu stia Cristina de ce sunt astia-n stare
S-a trezit in plina strada cu corpul la vanzare
Cum nu-i sta in caracter ca mama ei i-a zis
Nu-ti vinde demnitatea pentr-un colt in paradis
Ea pleaca cu capu sus ca stie c-o asteapta 
Un viitor mai bun cand viata e nedreapta
Ma-ntreb pe unde e acum aceasta luptatoare
Ce poa sa scrie-o carte despre cum sa ai onoare
O cheama  Cristina de la etajul 6

Strofa 3:

Curios din fire am batut la usa
Mi-a deschis chiar mama ei umila si supusa
I-am zis saru’ mana doamna, aveti 5 minute 
Si s-a asezat pe scaun curioasa sa m-asculte
Ce stiti de Cristina e bine sanatoasa?
Stiu ca a plecat din tara, se mai intoarce-acasa?
Mi-a zis fiule e bine, a avut grele momente
Dar trimite bani  lunar ca sa-mi iau medicamente
Si-a gasit un job stabil, are barbat si copil
I-a fost foarte dificil ca e un suflet fragil   
Cu lacrimi in ochi ea  tinea la piept scrisoarea
Una fata ei scria “mama n-am vandut onoarea”
Prin noroi cu capul sus exact cum  m-ai invatat
Ca sa-mi gasesc fericirea cu oamenii m-am luptat
Asa scria Cristina in timp ce lacrima

Intro :

 - In sufletul fiecarui om, clipa de clipa decurge o lupta, care se aseamana cu o lupta dintre doi lupi. Unul reprezinta: raul, invidia, gelozia, dezamagirea, egoismul, ambitia si minciuna. Celalat reprezinta: pacea, dragostea, speranta, adevarul, bunatatea si devotamentul.
 - Si care dintre acesti doi lupi castiga?
 - Intotdeauna castiga acela pe care tu il hranesti! 

Strofa 1: 

Norul naste ploaie cum floarea naste flori
Ura doar razboaie si dragostea, fiori
Frica naste lasi, sarutul, pasiune
Drumul cere pasi ca viata-i o misiune.
Viata naste vieti si noptile dimineti
Copacii , oxigen, inchisorile pereti.
Stresul naste boala, demnitatea, caracter  
Oamenii traiesc si pier sub acelasi cer.
Muzica naste trairi si focul caldura
Cuvintele pot fi pictura-n literatura!
Timpul naste ani, cartierele golani,
Saracia, datorii cand mancarea cere bani.
Omul naste zambet, dar naste si lacrimi
Naste judecata dreapta sau cade in patimi.
Omul! Cea mai complexa fiara
Face iadul sa-nfloreasca si raiul sa moara

Refren:

In pustiu ratacesc
Si cu mine vorbesc
In pustiu ratacesc
Si cu mine vorbesc

Strofa 2: 
 
Toate au un rost in lume nimic nu se schimba
Doar omul zi de zi e altul, nu-i cel din oglinda,
M-am inchis in sine, sa caut pacea-n mine
Si n-am deschis la nimeni ce voia sa ma aline.
Lumea s-a intors pe dos intr-un mod hidos
Sistem religios ce predica mincinos;
Ingerii cer ajutor, sunt ocoliti de medici
Iar diavoli deghizati in popi se plimba prin biserici!
Ceasornicul in anii mei cu sete groapa-mi sapa
Vad zilnic suflete prea mari ce au intrat la apa
Cum au venit au si plecat poate-asa mi-e scris in stele
Ieri ma iubeau, azi m-au uitat, cand zilele-mi sunt grele.
Si-apoi cand ii privesc in ochi gurile sunt mute
Atatia Iuda stau la coada obrazul sa-l sarute
Intr-un mediu surd, sunt ultima reduta
Ca mult prea multi m-aud, dar oare cati m-asculta?

Refren:

In pustiu ratacesc
Si cu mine vorbesc
In pustiu ratacesc
Si cu mine vorbesc

Strofa 3:

Impacat c-asa e viata, grea ca pietrele de moara
Impacat cu umarul gol ce crucea grea mi-o cara
Impacat vreau sa fiu liber stiu ca toate au un pret
Impacat cu ochii reci ce ma privesc cu dispret 
Padure fara uscaciuni, n-a fost niciodata
Asa cum viata din Iordan moare-n Marea Moarta
Fericirea-i perceputa in zeci de mii de feluri
D-aia pentru toti e transformata-n principale teluri
La ce bun sa nu fiu bun si mie mi-o spun,
Sa nu devin taifun si sa cer carne de tun,
Sa nu vreau sa ma razbun, demonii sa mi-i expun
Prin tot ce fac ce spun sa fiu perceput nebun!
Pun capul pe perna noaptea ascult viorile
Ca poate maine nu mai vine soarele cu zorile
Iar tie omule iti las toate piesele
Respectul si dragostea ce-mi oglindesc textele

See it doesn't take to much before some feelings start to form
Everything began so perfect wasn't tryna get involved
but the way you looked at me girl I just knew you wanted more
Oh you fooled me
OH ah OHHHH

If I knew what I knew now (wouldn't ever loved ya)
Girl ya heart so cold its blue
Got a soul as black as night
Lead me on, lead me on, let me loose

Now these 4 walls
Got me in a friend zone, friend zone (x2)
OH ah OHHHH

Taking a backseat to being your lover
Gave you my heart girl you threw in the gutter
So imma need answers
Would've sworn we had something but you look at me like its nothing
Oh you gone get repercussions, don't think that I'm bluffing
Quit tryna put me in the friend zone, I thought we had something to stand on
Girl look how you doing the mans wrong

Took it personal
I opened up you give me the cold shoulder
Girl what was that for
Always teasing me
So special every time you had me over
But tell me goodnight

If I knew what I knew now (wouldn't ever loved ya)
Girl ya heart so cold its blue
Got a soul as black as night
Lead me on, lead me on, let me loose

Now these 4 walls

You let me buy you things
I never asked for much
You turned your back on me
Why go and change it up
All of a suddenly

If I knew what I knew now (wouldn't ever loved ya)

A friend of mine send me this from Holland a year or so ago. It was probably re-broadcasted shortly before. 

This is just a free swinging blues with famous guitarist Wes Montgomery. He is accompanied by a group of young Dutch musicians, probably all still in their early twenties. Although unknown in the larger part of the world these are Pim Jacobs piano, his younger brother Ruud on bass and drummer Han Bennink. They can compete with the best in the larger part of that world. 

""Wes"" Montgomery1923 - 1968) Montgomery is often considered the greatest of modern Jazz guitarists.Montgomery toured with Lionel Hampton early in his career, however the combined stress of touring and being away from family brought him back home to Indianaopolis. To support his family of eight, Montgomery worked in a factory from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm, then performed in local clubs from 9:00 pm to 2:00 am. 
Instead of using a guitar pick, Montgomery plucked the strings with the fleshy part of his thumb, using downstrokes for single notes and a combination of upstrokes and downstrokes for chords and octaves. This technique enabled him to get a mellow, expressive tone from his guitar. Wes had a corn on his thumb, which gave his sound that point. He would get one sound for the soft parts, and then that point by using the corn. That's why no one will ever match Wes. And his thumb was double-jointed. He could bend it all the way back to touch his wrist, which he would do just to shock people."" 
He didn't have a very long to live to enjoy his commercial success, he died of a heart attack at age 45 in 1968",36,270,0,0,3103,2011-01-25 02:05:06,0,"classic, jazz, wes, montgomery, pim, jacobs",Blues in F - Wes Montgomey 1965,Dp_H9FYZy4E,412110,CJYBEAA,f,0,11,1,25,25,1,5.6150131529670215,2.227886704613673,3.4917817755841662,1.5563025007672873,5,4,0.2055531505531506,292,0.16666666666666666,5,0.0,6,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,2,2,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,31,0.6218652887285006,0.39677319427763735,2.243639507012711,0,0,3.0

0,Ashish Xiangyi Kumar,140,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"A sonata which illustrates beautifully Schumann’s narrative approach to the form, featuring typically vivid flights of fantasy bound together by the device of a falling perfect 5th. The falling 5th is first heard in the LH in the introduction [and is highlighted at 1:17 and 1:23], before it opens the main body of 1st movement [2:37] (with constant recurrences - 2:56, 3:00 etc). The 2nd movement unfolds over a sustained 5th in the bass, while the melody is punctuated by falling 5ths in the LH [12:56, 13:03, 14:29 etc], still with the same insistent dotted rhythm. In the 3rd movement the falling 5th appears in the LH at 16:04, and in the 4th movement the dotted falling 5th features prominently in the second theme: 19:56.

00:00 -- Mvt 1. Featuring an extraordinary introduction, with a melody fully formed enough to be considered a self-contained entity. Even when the introductory theme returns at the centre of the ensuing Allegro [9:15!], its reappearance seems to be an interruption, a sudden space opening in the midst of profound violence. In reality, of course, the introduction is a startlingly original bit of long-range anticipation, since its falling 5ths bind the whole work together. Note also the rapid harmonic turns of the allegro, and the way the falling 5th is absorbed into the ornamentation.
12:37 -- Mvt 2, Aria. Based on a song Schumann wrote when he was 18. It is significant that the falling 5ths were not in the original.  Liszt singled out this movement for special praise, calling it ‘a song of great passion, expressed with fullness and calm’.
15:22 -- Mvt 3. A scherzo with two trios.  The first quasi-trio's opening bars are underpinned by the 1st movement’s ‘rocking’ fifths motif, played pianissimo leggierissimo. The second trio ('Intermezzo') is a lovely parody of a polonaise, and Schumann marks it, appropriately enough, Alla burla, ma pomposo. There is a further surprise in store before the scherzo returns: a recitative, with a lone oboe rudely silenced by the whole orchestra, before the scherzo returns *at the wrong pitch* —a typically Schumannesque touch.
19:33 -- Mvt 3, Finale. A sonata-rondo featuring some pretty cool textures: tremolos mimicking a crescendo over a drum roll; a staccato passage near the close, marked quasi pizzicato; tutti chords punched out at top speed [22:17]. Notice how Schumann, with wicked inventiveness, pushes a duple-metre theme into the strait-jacket of three beats to the bar: rhythmic playfulness was one of the hallmarks of his style. The dramatic differences between this movement's two themes mirror the characters which Schumann quasi-allegorically adopted when composing: Florestan and Eusebius (representing the more turbulent and reflective sides of his character respectively).

Perahia handles the interpretative challenges of this difficult work extremely well: the rhythms are vital and intense, the knotty passages clear, the contrasts sharply (but not schizophrenically) outlined, and there is a clear sense of a coherent whole (often difficult to achieve in Schumann).",68,1771,0,0,2069,2016-03-18 12:45:00,0,"Schumann, Perahia, Sonata, F-sharp Minor, No.1, Op.11, Piano, Romantic, Classical, Virtuoso, Sheet Music, Score, Scrolling, Scherzo, Aria, Finale, Forestan and Eusebius","Schumann: Sonata No.1 in F-sharp minor, Op.11 (Perahia)",ruV4V5mPwW8,286980,CJYBEAA,f,0,16,3,18,78,4,5.4578516312556085,2.146128035678238,3.3157604906657347,1.8325089127062364,5,11,0.1478524743230625,485,-0.016666666666666666,16,-0.05,7,0,6,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,2,5,3,2,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,55,0.6075211850166998,0.3932184640908808,1.8094102940918542,0,1,3.0

Lyrics:
What's the trick I wish I knew 
I'm so done with thinking through 
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do
and I run right back to you
u crossed the line 
& it's time to say f-u!

What’s the point in saying that 
when u know how I’ll react 
U think u can just take it back
but shit just don’t work like that
you’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I’m stuck 
with you
and that’s that

Cus when it all falls down, then whatever 
When it don’t work out for the better
If we just ain’t right and it’s time to say goodbye 
when it all falls down,
when it all falls down
I’ll be fine 
I’ll be fine 
I’ll be fine

You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I’ll be fine

Why we fight, I don’t know
We say what hurts the most 
Oh, I try 
staying cold,
But you take it personal, 
All this firing shots,
and making grounder 
It’s way too hard to cope 
But I still 
Can’t let 
You go

So auch diesmal Stichpunkte aus dem Inhalt: -- Witze beurteilen als Strategie zur besseren a) Selbst-Erkenntnis: wenn wir erkennen, worüber wir besonders laut/herzlich lachen und b) Menschenkenntnis: wenn wir lernen, worüber jemand lacht. In beiden Fällen können wir viel über uns/ihn lernen -- das MUROH-Prinzip (mit Samariter-Effekt) -- das psychologische schwarze Loch als Metapher für a) die Pointe eines Witzes, der uns lachen macht und für b) die Bisoziation (nach Arthur KOESTLER), die sowohl für Humor als auch für Kreativität extrem wichtig ist. -- unsere Humor-Fähigkeit (5 Stufen), durch die Humor zum großartigen Anti-Streß-Mittel für uns werden kann (das überdies unser Immun-System stärkt!)",621,7570,0,1,15056,2013-02-03 23:16:49,0,"Vera, Birkenbihl, Humor, in, unserem, Leben",Vera F.

The Other F Word is a 2011 American documentary film directed by independent filmmaker Andrea Blaugrund Nevins. The film explores the world of aging punk rock musicians, as they transition into parents and try to maintain the contrast between their anti-authoritarian lifestyle with the responsibilities of fatherhood, the titular ""other F word"". In addition to interviewing over twenty musicians from across the spectrum of the punk genre, from Mark Hoppus of Blink 182 to Fat Mike of NOFX, the film also includes other emblematic figures of subculture such as professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, in a chronicle of the struggles and rewards that accompany raising their children.

It was released in the U.S. by Oscilloscope Laboratories in 2011.
----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­-------------

PREMISE

Primarily rotating around interviews of Pennywise lead singer Jim Lindberg, the documentary intermittently switches amongst different musicians, as it jumps between their travels on the road doing concert tours and time spent at home with their kids. In the course of the movie, the interviews are interspersed with archived concert footage of the punk rockers, from recent shows as well as their early years, to depict some of the challenges they face in their roles as parents - while at the same time maintaining their roles as anti-establishment figures for their punk rock fan following. Remarking that their adolescence often lacked much in the way of paternal guidance,[2] the interviewees speak of how they earnestly are trying to be the supportive role models for their kids, that they themselves never had while growing up.

PRODUCTION

The film's first-time director Nevins, initially conceived of the idea for the documentary after reading a book by Jim Lindberg called ""Punk Rock Dad"",[2] that explored his own feelings of being the raucous punk rocker of his band Pennywise, while at the same time raising kids. Thinking of the punk rock and fatherhood combination as a ""fun oxymoron"", Nevins originally believed the film would be in the spirit of a comedy, but after realizing how layered and heartfelt the experiences of the men she interviewed really were, the direction of the film changed significantly. The relatively low-cost budget of the film was maintained by the use of its inexpensive camera work and a soundtrack that features most of the artists interviewed throughout the film.
----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­-------------

BOX OFFICE

The Other F Word garnered $53,200 in gross earnings, bringing in $13,286 with its opening weekend premiere in two theaters.

CRITICAL RECEPTION

The documentary received generally positive reviews from critics, with Jeanette Catsoulis of The New York Times describing it as ""a compelling and often touching peek at punk paternity"" and Joe Heim of The Washington Post praising the film's dual nature as ""beautifully shot and requisitely gritty."" Rotten Tomatoes lists twenty-two fresh reviews of the film giving it a 76% overall rating.

0,Ashish Xiangyi Kumar,287,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Another lovely performance from Kissin. I especially like the tempos chosen for the slow movement, which are very slow indeed (I appear to have a thing for slow movements). Brahms' style can appear rather musically ugly (in the sense that he really had no affinity at all for attractive melodies and leaned towards muddy LH textures) and disjointed (very rapid textural changes), but this performance manages to bring structural integrity and clarity to an important and difficult work.

Sol Louis Siegel's fine description, which misses out some important structural elements and musical puns that I might put in the description later:
 
""In terms of both form and expression, Brahms' Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor is conceived on a grand scale. The first movement, marked Allegro maestoso (though many pianists seem to play it Adagio maestoso), indeed opens majestically, with a theme marked by great solid chords that range across the entire keyboard. The second subject begins lyrically, but it, too, swells in grandeur, and the whole movement builds to a triumphant climax in the bright major mode. The slow movement, Andante, is one of the great love poems in music, its two lyrical themes combining at last in a magnificent expression of rapturous passion. The Scherzo is a dark and dramatic waltz for which the grandly solemn, chordal Trio provides welcome relief. A haunting Intermezzo, a disturbing movement with ghostly echoes of the Sonata's opening, is followed by the Finale, in which a dark, gnarly dance of death is contrasted with a broad, confident chordal second subject. In contrast to conventional sonata practice, the second theme ultimately prevails, bringing this youthful masterwork to a triumphant conclusion.""",107,2262,0,0,2986,2014-07-15 03:36:56,0,"Evgeny Kissin (Musical Artist), Johannes Brahms (Composer), F Minor, F Major, Sonata, Allegro, Andante, Nodale Cantabile, Nodame Cantabile, Sonata No.3, Score, Sheet Music, Scrolling, Piano, Classical, Scherzo, Finale, Intermezzo, Bach, Japan, South Korea, United States, Italy, Poland, Szymanowski, Concerto, Brahms Sonata, Difficult, Fast, Romantic, Soothing, Orchestra, Plays, Liszt, Peter Rosel",Brahms: Sonata No.3 in F Minor (Kissin),Abby2S5OSXM,535745,CKwCEAA,f,0,14,7,15,196,1,5.728958126549998,2.4578818967339924,3.4750898033890065,2.0293837776852097,5,29,0.12855623100303948,298,-0.04107142857142857,34,-0.05,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,0.6065832087834999,0.4290277293777567,1.7123867065463698,0,0,3.0

During more than 34 years of fleet service, the F-14 Tomcat transformed from analog fighter to digital precision attack platform.

Originally designed to keep Russian bombers away from the battle group by employing Phoenix missiles at very long range, by the time the Tomcat was retired in 2006 it was capable of missions as far-ranging as forward air control, reconnaissance, close air support, and precision deep-strike, which made it CENTCOM’s platform of choice over Afghanistan and Iraq.

Bernhard Henrik Crusell (15 October 1775 – 28 July 1838) was a Swedish-Finnish clarinetist, composer and translator, ""the most significant and internationally best-known Finnish-born classical composer and indeed, — the outstanding Finnish composer before Sibelius"".

Conductor: Gérard Korsten

Crusell's Concerto in F minor, Opus 5, has been dated to 1815. It was dedicated to Alexander I, Tsar of Russia, and published, when the necessary permission had been granted, in 1818. The choice of key and the nature of the thematic material make of this work something very different. 

The first movement is again in the expected form, with an orchestral exposition dominated by the principal theme, leading to the entry of the soloist. Again in the solo writing there is a full use of the resources of the instrument and the composer's own virtuosity as a performer, with the two characteristic registers of the clarinet exploited at once, before the development of the theme by the solo instrument. The key of F minor allows an additional element of drama and occasional poignancy that is very much of its period. A portrait of the composer painted in the 1820s by Johan Gustaf Sandberg shows him holding the score of the concerto with the principal theme of the first movement seen in the music he is holding, a suggestion of its importance to him. 

The D flat major slow movement, an Andante pastorale in a lilting 9/8 metre, gives a chance for display of another kind, in its dynamic changes and contrasts, with final echo effects that offer, incidentally, a further technical challenge in the demand for the softest playing imaginable, as the clarinet answers the orchestra. The movement is followed by a final F minor Rondo of great charm, ending in a positive F major.",19,1392,0,0,679,2015-01-24 00:42:17,0,"Classical music, Bernhard Henrik Crusell (Composer), Clarinet Concerto No.2 in F-minor, Op.5, Per Billman, Uppsala Kammarorkester, Gérard Korsten","Bernhard Henrik Crusell - Clarinet Concerto No.2 in F-minor, Op.5 (c. 1817)",_HtXSeZlnuE,88642,CMIDEAA,f,0,15,1,24,24,5,4.947639546337028,1.6232492903979006,2.8318697742805017,1.2787536009528289,4,4,0.12713957759412306,323,0.0,6,0.0,11,0,2,0,2,1,5,0,0,1,4,0,1,3,1,6,4,1,0,7,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,75,0.5723678428387271,0.3280856002534925,2.2145546821298567,1,0,3.0

ПРОТИВ ШЕРСТИ: ГРУППА АГОНЬ ВЫПУСТИЛА АГРЕССИВНО-ПРОТИВОКАЦИОННЫЙ КЛИП «ВСЕМ FUCK»

Хейтерам, слабонервным и фитоняшкам убедительная просьба удалиться от экранов. В новой работе группа АГОНЬ кричит о том, что другие артисты мечтают сказать, но боятся произносить вслух.

О ЧЕМ КЛИП?

Мы давно хотели делать больше хип-хоп и рэпа и этот трек максимально близок нам по духу в данный момент. Слоган Зипули «Всем Fuck, занимаюсь спортом я» расположил нас к острому и конкретному троллингу в куплетах, который объяснил бы, что мы услышали в этой фразе и почему взяли в песню столь резкий месседж. Эта строчка - условный девиз современного мира глобализации, конкуренции и потребления. Таким образом, припев вовсе не означает, что мы плевали на всех и вся. Мы честно рассказали о себе и о недостатке искренности и глубины в актуальном сейчас массовом музыкальном продукте.

ДЛЯ КОГО КЛИП?

Наш провокационного трек - это троллиног любого медиа персонаж, который, так сказать, “зашкварился”. В первую очередь самих себя. “Всем FUCK” - мощный слоган социально-активного, прогрессивного человека, который своим неожиданным и самобытным поведением устанавливает новые правила игры.
 
Месседж для фанов очень простой - занимайся тем, что любишь больше всего, будь искренним и настоящим, гни свою линию, не слушай хейтеров, никому не подражай, делай осмысленные поступки, не бойся быть особенным, создай новый огонь с нуля и неси за все это ответственность.

ПРИ ЧЕМ ЗДЕСЬ ЗИПУЛЯ?

Зип a.k.a Зипуля a.k.a Человек-Птеродактель a.k.a Шоу-балет Макдональдс - наш старый приятель ещё с тех времён, когда тусовка на Крещатике была самым центральным местом для представителей всех молодёжных субкультур. Мы часто “висели” вместе и танцевали брейк-данс у метро. Поэтому договориться о колаборации не составило никакого труда. Именно он, уникум уличного стиля, неожиданно легко и точно смог 
сформулировать протестное настроению нашего нового трека.


Трек «Всем FUCK» уже доступен на всех цифровых площадках страны.

Minhas cadelas só chupam não mordem
Fazem fila eu como todas por ordem
Ouro na boca mas nem bebi Golden 
Tudo o que eu cuspo esses niggas engolem
Tipo uma abelha eu só ando com Pólen 

Eu sei que vou ficar rico por isso é que eu nem me preocupo em gastar o meu cash

Niggas pensam que eu trafico porque eu nunca fico parado ao contrário do resto 

Tantas namoradas ao mesmo tempo nem eu próprio sei quem foi a minha ex

Tenho uma Zuka que quase causa Sismos a cada vez que aquela bunda mexe

Tou a fazer paca mas eu nem cozinho 
Minha Weed é mais verde que os olhos do Kinho
As vossas princesas me chamam de King
E lutam por mim eu vou lhes dar um ringue

Eu sei que o teu boy sente inveja de mim
Mas nunca mostrou só lhe vejo a dormir
Eu perdi 300 Euros no Casino 
Mas eu fiz o dobro no dia seguinte 

(Refrão)
Eu ganho a minha própria massa e compro tudo o que eu preciso
Os meus niggas são tão loucos metem coisas nas bebidas
Eu raramente tou sóbrio e passo noites sem dormir 
Cotas todos a dizer que eu sou mais novo sem juizo

Eu sou o mais novo sem juizo 
(E ninguém vai me mudar)
Eu sou mais novo sem juizo
(É claro que eu vim do Bairro)
Eu sou mais novo sem juizo
(E ninguem vai me mudar)
Eu sou mais novo sem juizo
(E é claro que eu vim do bairro)

(Verso Michel)

Sou mais novo sem juizo
Tu não pisas onde eu piso
Tou ciente quero um ""txitxo""
Trás bebida mete nisso
Tou com os niggas que eu preciso
No fundo tu sabes que isto é só reals
Fazemos meals
Damas para mim são negócios minha dick tá cheia de deals

Entorno a bebida parece torneira
Eu não mudo mesmo que o mundo queira
Deixa me tar a pausar com a tropeira
Não tenho sangue só álcool na veia
Como essas bitches não tenho maneiras
Não vem com beef tou sem brincadeira 
Bitch ajoelha tipo que é uma freira
E na cama grita tipo que é uma feira

Bebida tu sabes não nego mais
Espera uma beca que eu pego mais
Fodo duas bitches com o Zara no final da noite nós vemos quem pera mais
Baby só podemos ser amantes 
Viajo nessa bula tou distante
Não vou ser o mesmo que eu era antes
Vou ter aquilo que não tinha antes

Trago a minha bicth de London pa fazer um dab
Repara no preto com cap
So quero fazer money fast
Safoda o respect
Por isso é que um gajo investe 
Deixa me tar com os meus dreds 
Um gajo nao esquece 
Daqueles que tiveram e tu não tiveste
Aqui tu perdes
Moca de "" whaska "" ta meter os niggas ficarem bad's

I had the most amazing time working on this project :) I've always wanted to do a Disney song, and I am so happy that I got to work on it with Peter Hollens and blessed to be able to work with Disney themselves on this! They have been so incredible, and you should all definitely go buy their Disney Classics box set! 

Big thanks to Walt Smith for shooting the underwater shots in Kiss The Girl! It was SUCH a pleasure working with you :) I had a weird fear of being under water, and he totally made me look like I knew (kinda) what I was doing.
Thank you SO much to FifGen for producing this amazing video. They are so insanely talented. Everyone go subscribe to their channel here: http://YouTube.com/fifgenfilms

itt már árad a kút
a promóciótok is átalakult
már csak lájtos treppeket vállal a krúd

kár, hogy 9 fake profil - 1 meg az anyád -

az agyadnak csapda kell
de a szíved már 120-as takkra ver,

nagy házban élek, csak panel,
Látod, az agyadnak csapda kell
Belesétáltok, nem kaptok el,
hogy likvidálnál, ha már likvid vagyok?
szét vagyok folyva mint az akvarell.
A ti agyatok meg két éve bootol,
mert offolgatja a tömeg giccse.
Mondd mégis, hogy érnétek utol,
ha nem tudtok követni se?!
ne beszéljek másról meg máshogyan,
maradjunk szétunt témáknál?

Hell0 apparently you guys have an issue with the speed of the video. I sincerely apologise it’s just that I thought some of the sentences were on for longer then they needed to be. Simple sentences like “she is Korean” or “She’s Thai” I thought didn’t have to be on there for so long, but apparently they do, so again, I apologise and if in the future I make another guide, I will keep this in mind.

Please also keep in mind that the background music I used was from the album’s highlight medley, and so I needed to give all the information I could in about twenty or so seconds. I also thought that you guys would be able to pause if it got too fast, which was kind of silly of me I guess. You should be able to watch the video with no interruptions. I’m sorry, sincerely – I could’ve added on a few seconds for each sentence.

Please continue to stan (G)I-DLE and forgive me for the huge mistake. Thank you for understanding !!

Because these girls are predebut, there aren't many clips or facts, and no clips at all for Shuhua's part. I really am apologetic, and I hope that these girls grow into amazing idols and and I hope this guide kind of convinces you to try and learn about them. They really are amazing angels and you won't regret stanning them !!

I hope you are influenced by my video to support these girls, and watch their MV and stream their album. I hope you all enjoy the video !!

Lyrics: Verse One: Puff Daddy
Out of this world like Mars when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggaz bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers
Chorus:
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets -- these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality
Verse Two: Jay-Z
Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't she'd
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin of Rome
Reoccuring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggaz study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, onee seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
To the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin or clappin have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin, I'm clappin your way
Chorus
Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggaz represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggaz with punany, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggaz call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental..
What? From a, from a young G's perspective.. (repeat 2X)

0,Carey R. Meltz,4,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Of Bach's four orchestral suites, the third (BWV 1068) is the best known, largely due to its famous Air. This suite in D major, consists of five movements: Overture, Air (strings and continuo only), Gavottes I & II, Bourrée, and Gigue. All movements except for the Air are scored for three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings, and continuo. The oboes rarely play independently of the violins in this work. The trumpets and drums are used for color and emphasis. Typical of Bach's suites, this one consists of mostly binary movements (two-part forms) based on French dances.

The original suite was generally believed to have been written by Bach for his patron Prince Leopold of Anhalt some time between the years 1717 and 1723. However, the oldest surviving score is later, dating from Bach's time in Leipzig. Current thinking is that the suite may well have been written in that city for performance by the Collegium Musicum. The source of this later score is a partially autograph set of parts from 1730; Bach wrote out the first violin and continuo parts, C.P.E. Bach wrote out the trumpet, oboe, and timpani parts, and J.S. Bach's student, Johann Ludwig Krebs wrote out the second violin and viola parts. It has also been argued that the original was a version for strings and continuo alone.

The title of the popular 2nd movement, commonly referred to as the ""Air on a G String"" comes from the late 19th century arrangement of the work by German violinist August Wilhelmj (1845-1908) for violin and piano. By transposing the key from its original D major to C major and transposing the melody down an octave, Wilhelmj was able to play the piece on only one string of his violin, the G string. Later, a spurious story was put about that the melody was always intended to be played on the G string alone.

Unlike the suite's other movements, the ""Air"" is not a French dance; its lyrical melody acts as Baroque version of a wordless, instrumental ""Aria"" (the Italian form), which unfolds slowly, almost infinitely so in a highly Romantic style with much vibrato. The Air’s long opening note, as a rhythmic device, can give the impression of eternity; but it is the ""walking"" bass that provides the forward momentum. The leads' ""trembling voices"" act to unify the piece as well as provide its progression, giving great balance of mood throughout. The texture for the Air is not nearly as dense as the preceding Overture, but it retains much of its polyphonic texture; the second violin and viola both have melodic fragments that answer the phrases in the main melody, creating an effect of antiphony. 

The late 60's rock band Procol Harum introduced the Air to an entirely different audience with their best-known recording of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale."" This 1967 hit single is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have ever sold over 10 million copies.

This alternate version is presented more traditionally as a chamber piece for synthesized ""string ensemble with continuo.""

In May of last year, ‘Triple H’ who appeared amid high expectations returned to their second mini album in about a year.

‘Triple H’ is a trio project group formed by Cube Entertainment. There are HyunA, the unrivaled female solo, Hui and E'Dawn of Pentagon, who have recently achieved the recognition of their singer-song writer abilities through ‘Shine’ which has quickly climbed the music charts. Through this album, HyunA who has demonstrated her own sexiness and trendy sense by challenging new music and performances, and Hui and E'Dawn who have showed their talent by participating in the production of their own album will generate a significant synergy effect.

http://ganjamafiashop.com/1046-kali-v8t.html
🎧 ALBUM W WERSJ CYFROWEJ http://www.soundline.biz/Kali30KMH


„V8T” to oznaczenie jednostki napędowej automobilu Kaliego, który za sprawą ciągłego życia w trasie, stał się dla niego swoistym drugim domem, rodząc tym samym koncept albumu. 

„V8T” to 14 nowoczesnych numerów. To podróż na koncert u boku Kaliego, którą można porównać do rozmowy dwóch dobrych ziomków. Metafory na tym się nie kończą, ponieważ większość z tytułów, powierzchownie skoligowanych z samochodem, odnajduje swoje odbicie na płaszczyźnie egzystencjalnej rapera. 
I tak w kawałku „Opary” dowiecie się, co czuje przemęczony człowiek „jadący na oparach” energii życiowej, utwór „Navi” zaprowadzi Was do domu Kaliego będącego obecnie przystankiem na trasie, o którym z kolei traktuje numer „Pit Stop”. 

Po eklektycznym 50/50, retrospekcyjnym „Gdy Zgaśnie Słońce”, osobistym „Sentymentalnie"", koncepcyjnym „Krime Story” oraz ezoterycznej „Chakrze” - Kali po raz pierwszy oddaje do rąk słuchaczy album na czasie, którego zawartość liryczna dotyczy jego obecnej sytuacji życiowej . 
V8T to osobista relacja z pierwszej ręki pozbawiona przesadnego patetyzmu i moralizatorstwa. Jak zawsze u Kaliego,całość ubrana w dojrzałe teksty w których nie zabraknie osobistych spojrzeń w głąb siebie, szczerej relacji z życia codziennego ale też dosadnych, świadomych własnej pozycji oraz punktujących chore zjawiska na scenie braggów. 
Kali w nowoczesnej odsłonie charakteryzuje się ciętym językiem i ekwilibrystycznym flow podanym na wszechobecnym 808. Całość kwituje wpadającymi w ucho refrenami.

Za całą produkcję na albumie, odpowiada absolutny debiutant FLVWLXSS, który trzymając rękę na pulsie aktualnych trendów, przygotował wybuchową muzyczną mieszankę. Na płycie w symbiozie obok siebie współgrają koncertowe bangery, rozmyte, chilllujące cloudy, jak i rozpalające obecnie klubowe parkiety afro trapy. 
Gościnnie na „V8T” pojawił się Paluch.

Intro (Tataee, Uzzi):
Ar fi putut să fie ceva de suflet... Dar este ceva de suflet...
Ar fi putut să fie ceva liric... Dar este ceva liric...
Ar fi putut să fie armonie... Dar este armonie ...
Ar fi putut să fie ceva frumos... În pula mea, frumos n-a fost să fie!

Pentru toate jartelele, jarteluțele și celelalte panarame...
Masculine, feminine sau între...

Strofa I (Tataee):
N-am văzut sub soare atâta depravare, // Mereu pe-mbârligare... Definiție: lichea.
O arzi la-nduioșare, povești adormitoare, // Cu voce bocitoare... Morții mă-tii de jartea...
Zici c-ai bani în buzunar, da-ntinzi mâna după dar, // Zici că nu vrei ajutor, doar un binefăcător...
Zici că vrei să ne-ntâlnim, să vorbim, să plănuim... // Morții mă-tii, zic așa, du-te, mă, în pula mea...

Pre-refren (Tataee):
Vrei banii mei și timp din viața mea, // Jelești p-aici la fel ca o manea...
Hai, fii atent acum, ascultă-mi glasu' // Că-ți dau în clar mesaju' meu și Planet H 'ți dă-n cap cu basu'...

Refren (x2) (Tataee, Uzzi, Caddillac):
Morții mă-tii de jartea, ți-am ghicit intenția, // Treaba sună a belea, bate-n ușa altuia...
Proastă atitudinea, ieftină vrăjeala ta, // Ce ai tu e boală grea, morții mă-tii de jartea...

Strofa a II-a (Caddillac):
Dacă limuzina ta e-o Dacie pe gaz, // Dacă spui că-ți faci o vilă când n-ai bani de-un aragaz,
Dacă trebuie să plătești și te scuzi că nu ai azi, // Eu atunci te fut în gură, ce să-i faci, așa e-n jazz...
Vorbești cu adâncime, parc-ai ieșit din filme, // Da' când vezi căcatu' scoți limba de doi coți...
Morții mă-tii, te rog eu, stai aici pe timpu' meu, // Tai-o că mă enervezi și te servesc cu un voleu...

Pre-refren (Caddillac):
Vrei banii mei și timp din viața mea, // Jelești p-aici la fel ca o manea...
Hai, fii atent acum, ascultă-mi glasu' // Că-ți dau în clar mesaju' meu și Planet H 'ți dă-n cap cu basu'...

Refren (x2) (Tataee, Uzzi, Caddillac):
Morții mă-tii de jartea, ți-am ghicit intenția, // Treaba sună a belea, bate-n ușa altuia...
Proastă atitudinea, ieftină vrăjeala ta, // Ce ai tu e boală grea, morții mă-tii de jartea...

Strofa a III-a (Uzzi):
Și suferă penalu' ca lindicu' principesei... // Doi pumni în pizdă, te bag pe sub mese...
Tovarăș cu tovarășu' meu, dar ce să fac // Dacă o arzi ca un căcat împăiat... Zdrang!!!
Iese iar cu necaz... (caz) Stroboscoape și bas... (bas) // Beat la greu și bas bas și mult de tras, mult de tras și Das Ultras...
Da' când zic că te bat, nu pe beat te bat, te bat oricum ar fi, te bat beat... // Zi mersi dacă te bat beat, e bine, de fapt, dacă sunt treaz și te bat te las lat...

Pre-refren (Uzzi):
Vrei banii mei și timp din viața mea, // Jelești p-aici la fel ca o manea...
Hai, fii atent acum, ascultă-mi glasu' // Că-ți dau în clar mesaju' meu și Planet H 'ți dă-n cap cu basu'...

Refren (x2) (Tataee, Uzzi, Caddillac):
Morții mă-tii de jartea, ți-am ghicit intenția, // Treaba sună a belea, bate-n ușa altuia...

ІВАН ПОПОВИЧ та гурт РОКАШ у новому кліпі показали неймовірну красу озера ""СИНЕВИР""

Нова пісня ""До Сонця близько"" - другий досвід співпраці закарпатського гурту Рокаш з Народним артистом України Іваном Поповичем. Два роки тому музиканти вже видали спільний кліп на пісню ""Закарпаття моє"". Зовсім нова пісня ""До Сонця близько""  стала продовженням тематики, започаткованої минулим дуетом. Краса Карпат стала провіднною темою і у новому кліпі. 
Режисером відео став закарпатець Андрій Олаг. Він вирішив зробити головним героєм кліпу не сюжет, а застиглу красу озера ""Синевир"", яке ще називають морським оком. На осінь озеро зміліло, і посеред води утворився острівець, який став гарною сценою для музикантів. Усе інше зробило ранкове розсіяне світло та гірські пейзажі навколо. Попри несонячну температуру повітря музиканти зуміли передати гарні світлі емоції на відео. Як кажуть місцеві мешканці, озеро стане повновіднішим після танення снігів.

Слова пісні написав закарпатець Петро Мага, на музику їх поклав сам Іван Попович, а аранжування зробили Остап Панчишин та Мар'ян Криськув на львівській студії JENNY:REKORDS.
Приємного перегляду!

Гуцул пару обирає, бо до Сонця близько.

На весіллі танцювати так, що стало слизько
Зорі в небі заспівали, бо до Сонця близько
У долині ставить хату, хто літає низько
Я літаю у Карпатах, бо до Сонця близько

Вийшла сонечко Анничка, стала до колиски
А чому Іван радіє? Бо до Сонця близько
Хай нам Сонеччко засяє синевирським блиском
Я люблю тебе, мій краю, бо до Сонця близько
Я люблю свої Карпати, бо до Сонця близько

Original Lyrics in English
There comes a moment when my heart must stand alone
On this lonely path I've chosen
Like a house that's not a home

Sometimes when I feel I've had enough
And I feel like giving up
You willed me to be all I can be
Now nothing can stop me

I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I

This is the moment we have dreamed of all our lives
We'll be the change we wish from others
We'll stand tall for what is right
And in my heart there'll be no doubt
The arms of the world will come reaching out
And embrace me to be all I can be
Now nothing can stop me

I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I
I believe in the power of you and I

I believe, I believe, I believe in
I believe, I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe in
I believe, I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I

I believe the time is right now
To stand tall and make the world proud
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power
I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
(I imagine you and me)
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I
(I imagine)
I believe the time is right now
(I believe in you and I)
Stand tall and make the world proud
I believe together well fly
I believe in the power of you and I

Lyrics:

On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round

[J. Cole:]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you're a woman, I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels, I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you can't face what's wrong, no need to fix
What God already put his paint brush on, your roommate yelling
""""Why you gotta take so long?"""" What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[J. Cole:]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while, but I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 - J. Cole (TLC):]
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em
(You're the one that was tryna keep me way down)
(But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round...)

[J. Cole:]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail, wonder why we inhale
Cause we in hell already - I ask if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hey, hell naw - I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now

Lyrics:

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossing turning in my bed
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
weep...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?",2969,226,0,1,119399,2010-09-27 18:03:39,1,"obsession, i promise you, obsesion, acoustic, music, suga suga, Frankie JVevo, Frankie J live, Frankie J Obsesion (No Es Amor) official, hd, Daddy's little girl, Frankie J, official, download, Obsesion (No Es Amor) live, how to deal, remix, still, lyrics, official video, cover, Obsesion (No Es Amor) lyrics, FrankieJ Obsesion (No Es Amor), original, that girl, Sony, Vevo, don't wanna try, more than words, Frankie J lyrics, music video, single",Frankie J - Obsesion (No Es Amor) (English Video Version),hY73MQOpg-0,14572094,CDIQAA,j,0,10,9,27,270,0,7.163521964076166,3.5612206789339442,5.0770006894709,3.4726101975960453,7,39,0.1643253968253968,165,0.1481331168831169,31,0.0,9,0,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,1,5,0,1,1,1,4,5,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0.7087296884034401,0.4971326530152144,1.4620128377741657,0,0,3.0

Lyrics: 

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4,
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor,
Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more,
Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour,
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore,
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores,
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score,
If not i gotta move on to the next floor [whore - dirty version],        
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1,
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun,
When it come to pop man we do shit for fun,

Lyrics:
I want it all
I want it now
Forget about the consequences
I know that it’s bad, it’s better to wait 
But sometimes I can be selfish
And the only sound I hear is right now
And all my patience gets locked out
I know that it’s wrong
And I want to change
I need You here with me

Chorus:
Allah, Allah, Allah
Save me from myself
Allah, Allah, Allah
Lord I need Your help
Allah, Allah, Allah
Save me from myself
Allah, Allah, Allah 

Big lights pull me in every time
And it’s so hard to break a pattern
But I see it clear, what’s deep inside
Is the only thing that really matters
So tell me how, how to turn it around
Before my senses hit the ground
‘Coz I know that’s it’s wrong
And I want to change
I need You here with me

CHORUS

Save me from myself
‘Coz I tripped and fell
And there is nothing, nothing
that I won’t do
Oh, save me from myself
‘Coz I need Your help
And now I’m running, running
Back to You

En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición

Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo baby estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Que me quede otro round
tanto que me a rogado
Ya lo tengo oficiado
Yo te observado
No aguanta se adapta me dice
No quiero que termines
Es un misterio pero no de cine
En la noche soy yo la que define
Todo lo que va a pasar
a mi no me tienes que mandar

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo mami estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Uh se que me quieres ver
Bajando por toda tu piel
Uh se que quieres que me quede
Enredarte en mis piernas es lo que quieres 

No se vale el empate, esto es hasta darle jaque mate
Hasta que uno de los dos se mate
Si quieres yo bajo y de una me pongo pal' trabajo
Suelta el estrés, baby, yo te relajo
Se pone bella, me dice que ya
Sigue ahí, que la tengo viendo las estrellas
Se me acelera, hasta abajo se va
Y como ella lo hace, no lo hace cualquiera
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición
Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado

Allo c'est qui je n'entends pas ?
Allo pourquoi tu changes de voix ?
Tu prends de mes nouvelles
Mais qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Ha bon t'aurais vu ma jumelle ?
C'est ça qui t'angoisse

Pour toi j'ai tout donné
Et malgré tout ça mon gars tu as fauté
Ha j'ai galéré aujourd'hui tu me demandes de me retourner ?!
Il n'y a plus d'espoir toi et moi c'est fini c'est mieux comme ça !
Tu avais trop soif maintenant tu assumes ça s'arrête là !
Non je ne peux pas le nier
Je ne pensais pas que j'allais m'en remettre

Short hair like Nia Long
Loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song
The stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands
I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
At the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends bring three
I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP rubber on I'm stretching that
Rich niggas tipping
Broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy.

Smokin' on Keysha, Cole give me chills nigga
What's your real name, and not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a motherfuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole

Lyrics:
I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached,
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

and on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
and I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else...
and I'm kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
and it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me

Leeds-based band alt-J formed in 2007. The three-piece band continue to excel as a genre-defying act, receiving nominations for Grammy Awards and the Brit Awards, as well as selling out arenas like the 02 and Madison Square Garden. 

Their signature blend of layered, folk-inflected dub-pop and soaring alternative rock was first heard in 2012 on their debut album 'An Awesome Wave. 2 years later, the band followed up with their sophomore album 'This Is All Yours', topping the UK Albums Chart, was runner up in Belgium, Australia, and Canada and reached #4 in the United States. In 2017, alt-J released their third album 'Relaxer'.

Vom Gamma zum Alpha, vom Welpen zum Leitwolf
Ist einer der besten, einer der letzten dieser Art
Teilt sein Fressen auch mit dem schwächsten Glied der Kette, wenn es ihn fragt
Lebt nach ungeschriebenen Regeln, durch seine Adern fließt noch Ehre
Er weiß genau man muss sie auch haben, als immer nur drüber zu reden
Doch lass sie reden

Und er geht
Immer der Sonne entgegen, auf der Flucht vor dem Regen
Er bleibt in Bewegung, auch wenn sie nachts nicht scheint
Egal wie kalt, egal wie weit
Seine Beine ihn tragen, vielleicht holt er sie ein

Lyrics

I bought my glove 
It was the best glove I've ever seen 
Stacking up that early crit chance 
It only cost me 400g

I heard a rustle in the brush 
And in that moment everything fell hushed 
And then I realized I got ganked

I ate oranges and it was k 
They were made fresh from Florida

I've got my citrus 
And I'm not talking tangerines 
This Wukong's going bananas 
Everything is going peachy keen 
Farming gold up with my Q 
And now I'm pushing up my lane 
Didn't bother buy wards 
Because today I'm not playing ranked

I heard a rustle in the brush 
And in that moment everything fell hushed 
And then I realized I got ganked

I ate oranges and it was k 
They were made fresh from Florida

Malzahar, it was k 
Teemo shroom, it was k 
Warwick ult, it was k 
Rammus taunt, it was k 
Got divorced, it was k 
Lost the kids, it was k 
Ship got towed, it was k 
Out of rum, not okay (T-T)

But I got oranges and it was k 
They were made fresh from Florida (Made not grrrrown!) 
No, you'll never have a bad day 
Just eat oranges and you'll k

I got oranges and it was k

Lyrics:
What's the trick I wish I knew 
I'm so done with thinking through 
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do
and I run right back to you
u crossed the line 
& it's time to say f-u!

What’s the point in saying that 
when u know how I’ll react 
U think u can just take it back
but shit just don’t work like that
you’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I’m stuck 
with you
and that’s that

Cus when it all falls down, then whatever 
When it don’t work out for the better
If we just ain’t right and it’s time to say goodbye 
when it all falls down,
when it all falls down
I’ll be fine 
I’ll be fine 
I’ll be fine

You’re the drug that I’m addicted to
And I want you so bad
But I’ll be fine

Why we fight, I don’t know
We say what hurts the most 
Oh, I try 
staying cold,
But you take it personal, 
All this firing shots,
and making grounder 
It’s way too hard to cope 
But I still 
Can’t let 
You go

All Falls Down,

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,431,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Mozart's Clarinet concerto in A major, K. 622 was written in 1791 for the clarinetist Anton Stadler. It consists of the usual three movements, in a fast-slow-fast form:
1. Allegro
2. Adagio
and 3. Rondo: Allegro.
It was also one of Mozart's final completed works, and his final purely instrumental work (he died in the December following its completion). The concerto is notable for its delicate interplay between soloist and orchestra, and for the lack of overly extroverted display on the part of the soloist (no cadenzas are written out in the solo part). Mozart originally wrote the work for basset clarinet, a special clarinet championed by Stadler that had a range down to low (written) C, instead of stopping at (written) E as standard clarinets do. As most clarinets could not play the low notes which Mozart wrote to highlight this instrument, Mozart's publisher arranged a version of the concerto with the low notes transposed to regular range, and did not publish the original version. This has proven a problematic decision, as the autograph no longer exists, having been pawned by Stadler, and until the mid 20th century musicologists did not know that the only version of the concerto written by Mozart's hand had not been heard since Stadler's lifetime. Once the problem was discovered, attempts were made to reconstruct the original version, and new basset clarinets have been built for the specific purpose of performing Mozart's concerto and clarinet quintet. There can no longer be any doubt that the concerto was composed for an extended-range clarinet. In this context it is worth noting two other works written for Stadler and his instrument by composers closely linked to the Mozart-Stadler circle that used the extended range of Stadler's instrument: the clarinet concerto by Franz Xaver Süssmayr (famous for having completed Mozart's Requiem) and that by Joseph Leopold Eybler. In recent years, the restored original version has been recorded by a number of different artists.
The concerto was given its premiere by Stadler in Prague on October 16, 1791. Reception of his performance was generally positive. The Berlin Musikalisches Wochenblatt noted in January of 1792, ""Herr Stadeler, a clarinettist from Vienna. A man of great talent and recognised as such at court... His playing is brilliant and bears witness to his assurance.""  There was some disagreement on the value of Stadler's extension; some even faulted Mozart for writing for the extended instrument.

Ho sbagliato tante volte ormai che lo so già 
che oggi quasi certamente 
sto sbagliando su di te ma una volta in più 
che cosa può cambiare nella vita mia... 
accettare questo strano appuntamento 
è stata una pazzia! 
Sono triste tra la gente 
che mi sta passando accanto 
ma la nostalgia di rivedere te 
è forte più del pianto: 
questo sole accende sul mio volto 
un segno di speranza. 
Sto aspettando quando ad un tratto 
ti vedrò spuntare in lontananza! 
Amore, fai presto, io non resisto... 
se tu non arrivi non esisto 
non esisto, non esisto... 
e cambiato il tempo e sta piovendo 
ma resto ad aspettare 
non m'importa cosa il mondo può pensare 
io non me ne voglio andare. 
io mi guardo dentro e mi domando 
ma non sento niente; 
sono solo un resto di speranza 
perduta tra la gente. 
Amore è già tardi e non resisto... 
se tu non arrivi non esisto 
non esisto, non esisto... 
luci, macchine, vetrine, strade 
tutto quanto si confonde nella mente 
la mia ombra si è stancata di seguirmi 
il giorno muore lentamente. 
Non mi resta che tornare a casa mia 
alla mia triste vita 
questa vita che volevo dare a te 
l' hai sbriciolata tra le dita. 
Amore perdono ma non resisto... 
adesso per sempre non esisto 
non esisto, non esisto...

In english: 
 I was wrong so many times till this point and I already know it
 that today almost certainly
 I am wrong on your behalf but one more time
 what can change in my life
 accept this strange date
 was madness
 I am sad between the people
 that go by me
 but the nostalgia to see you again
 is more powerfull than crying
 this sun lights up on my face
 a sign of hope
 I am waiting when suddenly
 I will see you appear from affar
 Love, hurry up, I can't resist...
 if you don't arrive I don't exist
 I don't exist,I don't exist...
 the weather has changed and it rains
 but I keep on waiting
 I don't care what the world thinks of me
 I don't want to go away
 I look inside me and I ask
 but I don't hear anything
 I am only a left-over of hope
 lost between the people
 Love it's already late and I don't resist
 if you don't arrive I don't exist
 lights, cars, shop-windows, roads/streets
 everything gets mixed up in my mind
 my shadow is tired to follow me
 the day dies slowly
 There is nothing else left than going back home
 to my sad life
 this life that I wanted to give to you
 you have crumbled her between your fingers

Eren devrait en apprendre plus sur son père dans l’épisode 11 de L’Attaque des Titans saison 3, d’après la vidéo teaser.

Grisha Jaeger semble en savoir beaucoup sur les titans et l'histoire de son peuple. Dans l’épisode 6 de L’Attaque des Titans saison 3, Eren découvre notamment que son père a tué quasiment tous les membres de la famille Reiss après s’être transformé en titan. Et le jeune homme ne devrait pas être au bout de ses surprises ! Dans la vidéo teaser de l’épisode 11, intitulé ""un simple spectateur"", Eren va avoir droit à de nouvelles révélations.

L'Amour en Solitaire

Solo dans ma peau
Sur la plage
J'me la joue mélo
Je drague les nuages

Solo dans ma fête
C'est dommage
A deux c'est tellement chouette
D'fumer des cigarettes
Sur la plage

Solo dans l'bateau
Je mets les voiles
Mais solo je prends l'eau
Des matelots

Où es-tu mon alter
Où es-tu mon mégot
Pour moi t'étais ma mère mon père mon rodéo
Je traverse le désert 
L'Amour en Solitaire

Reviens moi mon alter
Reviens moi héros
Je veux retrouver ma terre ma bière et mon tricot
Plus traverser le désert, l'Amour en Solitaire

Solo sur mon île
Sur ma plage
J'me tiens plus qu'à un fil
J'ramasse mon coquillage
Fragile

Solo dans ma gueule
J'peux plus voir
Te voir dans toutes ces gueules
En miroir

Où es-tu mon alter
Où es-tu mon mégot
Pour moi t'étais ma mère mon père mon rodéo
Je traverse le désert 
L'Amour en Solitaire

Reviens moi mon alter
Reviens moi héros
Je veux retrouver ma terre ma bière et mon tricot
Plus traverser le désert, l'Amour en Solitaire

Solo j'danse le slow
Sur ta plage
J'm'enroule dans les flots
Solo j'fais naufrage

Mais dans l'fond j'm'en fous
C'est pas grave
Sans toi j'devenais flou
Un point c'est tout.

PAROLES ~

J'entends les murmures de la ville
Que la nuit a mise à nu
Le fracas des automobiles qui filent
Juste un instant s'est tu

Dans la brume électrique elle dort
 
Et son corps encore inconnu
Laisse entrevoir

Son coeur qui cogne un peu plus fort
Toutes ces couleurs qui courent encore
Est-il trop tôt, est-il trop tard ?

C'est comme une fille qu'on embrasse
Mais qu'on ne voit jamais de face
Le refrain sans accords
Des sirènes du soir

C'est comme une fille qu'on embrasse
Mais dont le souvenir s'efface
Dites moi si je sors
Du rêve, du cauchemar

Paris, parie avec moi
Quitte à essayer cent fois
Paradis ou pas
Sous les pavés je te vois

Oh pari perdu avec toi
Qui voudrait d’une vie comme ça ?
Paris tu n'es pas
Comme au cinéma

Elle ouvre les yeux sans efforts
Se lève d'un seul coup
Et nous recrache par milliers
Sur ses Grands Boulevards

Fille noctambule fan de l'aurore
Femme de la nuit multicolore
Mais tes matins restent noirs

C'est comme une fille qu'on embrasse
Mais qu'on ne voit jamais de face
Le refrain sans accords
Des sirènes du soir

C'est comme une fille qu'on embrasse
Mais dont le souvenir s'efface
Dites moi si je sors

Lyrics apaisants je rappe les oiseaux se taisent
Fais-toi plaisir, écoute ça avec ta daisy
Ce matin j'suis bien dans ma peau, j'ai la pêche telle cette femme qui
Dame des parts de tartes par dizaines
Te dis pas frappé par un maléfice
Recommence ta vie à zéro quand je la redémarre à moins dix
Je suis né blasé sans un sou,
Puis brassé me suis retrouvé sans issue
J'suis rentré en collision avec mes obstacles
Tourne le pire à la dérision, l'offre en spectacle
Je me dois de tout tuer pour ceux qui n'ont pas le choix
Ma chanson va pas sauver le monde, tant pis pour cette fois
Si j'avais entendu les profs, je serais pas le type
Dont on étudie l'écriture laisse-les rire, faire mon truc
Je me suis fixé ce but si j'arrive à mi-chemin
Je ferai date comme ce tigre tué par un caniche nain
Tu connaîtras jamais la fin de l'histoire
En faisant demi-tour à deux minutes de la victoire
On peut viser ton blé, ta femme et son vison
Mais, qui peut se vanter d'avoir touché l'horizon

(R) J'irai plus loin que l'horizon 
C'est bien mieux que le bout de son nez
Tous les murs qui nous bloquent brisons
Avance et laisse-les klaxonner
Viens, la vitesse de mon son frisons / X2

Je me sens encore de ceux sur qui nul ne miserait
Autant de chapitres que de poils possède un bison
J'enchaîne les brochettes de problèmes, uppercut, esquive, crochet
Le revers de la médaille c'est mon emblème
Tu déconnes avec tes tonnes de projets
Ils vont encore s'entasser avec ceux de l'année prochaine
Viens, j'ai fait le plein de patience
Y'a assez d'essence pour rouler jusqu'à l'horizon
Qui m'aime me suive
Amène les cuivres, les guitares
Du pain et de l'huile d'olive
Le seul raccourci et ma potion, ne suis pas les panneaux
Aucun n'indique la bonne destination, Action !
Laisse-moi kiffer ma passion
M'échapper car à chaque page des marionnettes rêvent qu'on m'isole
Hélas plus on est de fous mieux on évite la camisole
J'te fais plein de feintes, pas de ceux qui démissionnent
Le plan se trouve en bas à gauche juste après do-ré-mi-sol

Paroles L'Aziza

Petite fille de casbah au milieu de casa
Petite brune enroulée d'un drap court autour de moi
Ses yeux remplis de pourquoi cherchent une réponse en moi

Elle veut vraiment que rien ne soit sur dans tout ce qu'elle croit

Ta couleur et tes mots tout me va
Que tu vives ici ou là-bas

Danse avec moi
Si tu crois que ta vie est la
Ce n'est pas un problème pour moi
L'Aziza, Je te veux si tu veux de moi

Et quand tu marches le soir ne trembles pas a- a-
Laisse glisser les mauvais regards qui pèsent sur toi L'Aziza

ton étoile jaune c'est ta peau tu n'as pas le choix
Ne la porte pas comme on porte un fardeau ta force c'est ton droit

Ta couleur et tes mots tout me va

Danse avec moi
Que tu vives ici ou là-bas
Ce n'est pas un problème pour moi

0,1947dave,692,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"This is the complete radio broadcast of the actual performance in Copenhagen with added video and stills from the reprise to enhance it. The original video recordings were lost or destroyed  so I used the short reprise video (more than once) to give a better feel for the original performance than the radio broadcast can give.  I have also corrected the short section where lipsync on the original reprise clip (as used by Eurovision) is out. I  will add more video when I  can.  I am doing this enhancement and reconstruction work for historical reasons, to give a unique and better insight into what it actually looked and sounded like as Gigliola sang,  all those years ago.

Then only 16 years old, Gigliola had what is still the highest ever percentage of ""1st place"" scores in the contest... 8 out of 15 possible, or 53.3%. Points scored were 'only' 49 but changes to the scoring system mean that points scores are not directly comparable from year to year. Just listen to the thunderous applause she received at the end!

It seems that  the broadcaster's video of the contest was destroyed, either deliberately because it was not thought to be worth keeping, or accidentally in a fire at the DR (Denmark) Studios in the 1970's. No other broadcaster kept a recording of  the 1964 show and the longest video clip of the winning song is of the reprise at the end, and is only about one minute long.  I have extended this to match the complete sound recording by re-using parts of the video where suitable, and by inserting stills.

Gigliola Cinquetti has been a well known singer in Italy, parts of Europe, South America and Japan, ever since her Eurovision win... including subsequent appearances in the same contest as singer (""Si"", or ""Go"" in English, came 2nd to Abba's Waterloo in 1974  and was a UK top ten hit) and in 1991 as a host. She remains a well known singer in Italy and from time to time, a TV presenter too. She has released many hit albums there.

Her record of this song (sung in Italian) entered the UK singles charts in 1964, reaching no. 17 and remaining in the chart (full chart not just top 20) for a remarkable 17 weeks, something that only three other Eurovision songs have achieved in the UK, though others have sold many more copies. Before winning Eurovision, Gigliola also won the San Remo Song Contest with the same  song - there are complete video recordings of that on the Internet and you can tell the difference because at San Remo, she wore a light coloured dress but at Eurovision a dark one.

LYRICS:

Non ho l'età, non ho l'età per amarti
Non ho l'età per uscire sola con te
E non avrei, non avrei nulla da dirti
Perchè tu sai molte più cose di me

Lascia ch'io viva un amore romantico

Non ho l'età, non ho l'età per amarti
Non ho l'età per uscire sola con te

Se tu vorrai, se tu vorrai aspettarmi
Quel giorno avrai tutto il mio amore... per te.

IN ENGLISH

The lyrics are about someone not yet old enough to be  romantically involved with the older, more experienced person they love... too young for them even to go out alone together. But if they are willing to wait, one day, the romance will be complete.

That's more or less the story, awww! The words were a bit controversial though at the time, and the original lyrics never to my knowledge had an official English translation using the same storyline. I think that's a pity as it was not advocating young love, it was advising young people to be patient and wait!",444,223,0,0,13779,2009-06-07 12:34:48,0,"Gigliola, Cinquetti, Non, Ho, L'Età, Eurovision, Song, Contest, Winner, 1964, Italy, San, Remo, Copenhagen",Gigliola Cinquetti - Non Ho L'Età - Eurovision Song Contest Winner 1964 (original performance),Utd9cHBPfRA,2510239,CN4CEAA,l,0,9,6,7,158,6,6.399715072652269,2.8401060944567584,4.1392177001375865,2.64738297011462,6,23,0.21732142857142853,665,0.0,13,0.375,13,0,3,0,1,0,5,1,3,0,9,0,0,3,1,9,9,1,1,5,2,5,2,1,0,0,0,0,94,0.646781560295644,0.4437863345812546,1.5635130039226537,1,0,3.0

L’exceptionnelle mise en image et en son permet aux téléspectateurs de s’immerger dans l'orchestre et propose une expérience d'écoute (et de vision) étonnante des chefs-d’œuvre de la musique classique.

De l’initiation musicale des plus jeunes au décryptage de la gestuelle du chef d’orchestre pour les plus calés, des souvenirs d’enfance des compositeurs à ceux de téléspectateurs mélomanes, de Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart au compositeur de musiques de films Danny Elfman, de L’Apprenti sorcier de Dukas à la série des Simpson, Patrick Leterme emmène petits et grands sur la route des mélodies enfantines.

LYRICS

Yo, How could I ever regret
The moment when we first met
Something I could never forget
I met a crazy beautiful girl right?
Who was just my type
So I tried to play the part
Tried to play to start
Hit it off on the first date
Though I admit I was nervous
To meet somebody that made me feel that way
Wanted to keep it cool
But coming off like a fool
And pinching myself for all of the things I’d say
I saw it coming from a mile away
I couldn’t stop it, It was just too late
Cause when you love somebody
Sometimes you’ve gotta be willing to let them go
Or at least sit back and wait
I really hope that we can be friends
But I don’t wanna live in the pretend
She started crying trying to defend
What can I say
She was my first love
And I imagined we would be together forever
But now I’m the source of a heart break

I can’t eat
cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you
Right now i’m missing you

All alone sitting up in my room
Holding my phone, just thinking bout you
And I wonder if your out there thinking bout me
It’s been a week since you went away
Told me it’s over and you needed your space
I put my heart in your hands and you threw it away 
But now I’m missing you

I can’t eat
cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you
Right now i’m missing you
(repeat)

Look, I never knew the right words to say
Hat in my hand since you walked away
Trying to cope but can’t take the pain
Wishing I could hear you say my name
Wishing I could take back it all
Is it too late for me to call
Cause I could have anything in this world I choose
But baby girl right now I’m missing you, MB

I can’t eat
cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you
Right now i’m missing you

I can’t eat
cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you

FREEZE! I'm Ma Baker - put your hands in the air,
gimme all your money

- This is the story of Ma Baker, the meanest cat
from ol' Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'cos they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

she met a man she liked
she thought she'd stay with him
one day he formed with them
they did away with him
she didn't care at all
just didn't care at all

- Here is a special bulletin.
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman.
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall.
If you have any information about this woman,
please contact the nearest police station...

- Don't anybody move! The money or your lives!

One day they robbed a bank
it was their last foray
the cops appeared too soon
they couldn't get away
and all the loot they had
it made them mighty mad
and so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons
they didn't want to hang
they died with blazing guns
and so the story ends
of one who left no friends

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I’ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I’ve grown 
but I can’t wait to go home 

I’m on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don’t reckon I did it right
I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid and buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we’ve grown
I can’t wait to go home

I’m on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone
One’s brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can’t wait to go home

And I’m on my way, and I still remember those country lanes
When we did not know the answers, And I miss the way you make me feel, it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

온전히 그녀들만의 색으로 가득 채워진 별, 볼빨간사춘기의 Full Album [RED PLANET]
특유의 순수한 소녀 감성으로 붉게 물들여져 있는 그녀들만의 세상은 어떤 세상일까?

올해 4월 Half Album [RED ICKLE]을 발매하며 2016년 화제의 신인밴드로 주목 받고 있는 여성 듀오 볼빨간사춘기가 Half Album의 완성체인 Full Album [RED PLANET]으로 돌아왔다.

더욱 다채롭고 깊어진 감성으로 촘촘하게 채워진 [RED PLANET]을 소개한다.

01. 우주를 줄게
사랑의 크기를 재는 물음에 지금까지 ""하늘만큼 땅만큼""이라고 말했었다면, 오늘부터 그에 대한 내 사랑의 크기는 단언컨대 ""우주를 줄만큼""이라고 대답할 것이다. 그녀의 세상에서 가장 큰 범위인 우주, 그 안에서 우주 비행사가 되어 어디든 그와 함께하고, 그의 곁에 머무는 반짝이는 별들과 은하수를 모두 주고 싶은 마음을 표현한 곡이다. 서정적이고 예쁜 가사와 밝은 멜로디가 돋보이는 곡이다.
작사 : 안지영, 우지윤 / 작곡 : 안지영, 바닐라맨 / 편곡 : 바닐라맨
Acoustic guitar: 바닐라맨 / Elec guitar: 이승엽 / Bass : 이동혁 / Chorus : 안지영

02. 싸운날
연애를 하다 보면 가끔 사소한 것에도 다투고 토라질 때가 있다. 싸운날은 말 그대로 남녀가 연애하면서 투닥투닥 싸운날을 귀여운 어린 소녀의 마음으로 표현한 곡이다. 처음에는 괜한 자존심을 내세우고 미워하다가도 시간이 지날수록 어쩔 줄 몰라 하며 상대방이 다시 처음으로 돌아와 주길 바라는 여리고 어린 감성이 잘 드러난다
작사 안지영 / 작곡 안지영 / 편곡 바닐라맨
Acoustic guitar 바닐라맨 / Elec guitar 이승엽 / Bass 김기범 / Chorus 안지영

03. You(=I) 
누구나 처음 하는 연애는 서툴고 어색하다. 알쏭달쏭 확신할 수 없는 그의 속마음에 닿아보려 떼도 써보고, 욕심도 부려보는 내게 그와 닮아가는 것만큼 심장 떨리는 순간이 있을까? 여리고 순수한 첫 연애의 감정을 솔직하고 귀여운 가사로 담아낸 곡으로 중독적인 멜로디가 포인트인 곡이다.
작사 : 안지영 / 작곡 : 안지영 / 편곡 : 바닐라맨
Acoustic. Guitar : 바닐라맨 / Elec. Guitar : 이승엽 / Chorus : 안지영, 바닐라맨

04. 심술
괜히 내겐 차갑고, 어리다는 이유로 마음을 몰라주는 상대방에게 심술을 부리는 귀여운 악동 같은 소녀의 모습을 표현한 곡이다. 그에게 들러붙는 여자들을 슬쩍 괴롭히고 못된 행동만 골라 하는 자존심 센 그녀가 항상 그의 주위를 맴돌며 하고 싶었던 말은 “사실은 널 진짜 많이 좋아해”
작사 안지영 / 작곡 안지영 / 편곡 바닐라맨
Guitar 바닐라맨 / Chorus 안지영 

05. 나만 안되는 연애 
매번 만남과 헤어짐을 반복했지만, 결국 찾아온 이별에 대한 준비도 못 한 채 더 이상 나를 사랑하지 않는 그를 떠나보냈다. 아무 말도 못하고 받아들여야만 하는 현실에 마음이 더 쓰리다. 다시 돌아와 주길 바랄 수조차 없는 불공평한 연애에 대한 가슴 저린 심정을 담은 발라드 곡이다.
작사 : 안지영 / 작곡 : 안지영, 바닐라맨 / 편곡 : 바닐라맨
Piano : 바닐라맨 / Elec Guitar : 이승엽 / Chorus : 안지영

06. 초콜릿
초콜릿을 먹으면 누군가와 사랑에 빠졌을 때와 비슷한 감정을 느끼게 해 준다고 한다. 사랑에 빠졌을 때 설레고 좋아하는 감정을 달콤한 초콜릿에 비유한 곡으로 초콜릿에 중독된 것처럼 자꾸 만 찾게 되고 나만 보고 싶은 귀여운 소녀감성을 표현한 곡이다.
작사 안지영, 우지윤 / 작곡 안지영, 바닐라맨 / 편곡 바닐라맨 
Acoustic guitar 바닐라맨 / Elec guitar 이승엽 / Bass 김기범 / Chorus 안지영 

07. 프리지아
지난봄 나는 그에게 프리지아 꽃을 선물해 달라고 했다. 기약 없이 떠나버렸지만 함께 했던 우리의 추억 그리고 그 향기는 아직도 내게 남아있다. 다시 만날 수 있음을 굳게 믿고 여전히 프리지아 꽃을 기다리는 순수하고 말간 감성이 노오랗게 피어나는 곡이다.
작사 : 안지영 / 작곡 : 안지영 / 편곡: 황종하
Elec. Guitar : 이승엽 / Chorus : 안지영

08. X Song 
노래가 가진 힘은 생각보다 크다. 사람들을 웃게 하고 울리기도 하고 위로도 해준다. 또한 과거의 어느 시간 속에 기억과 추억을 가두어 두고 꺼내어 볼 수 있게 한다. X song은 문득 들려온 익숙한 노래에 잊은 줄 알았던 지난 일이 떠오르고 그때는 몰랐던 또 알 수 없었던 감정들을 뒤늦게 깨달아 아파하는 마음을 표현한 노래이다.
작사 : 바닐라맨 / 작곡 : 바닐라맨 / 편곡 : 바닐라맨
Guitar : 바닐라맨, Chorus : 안지영

09. 반지
‘난 괜찮아. 날 좋아해 줄 사람은 많아.’
좋아해 줄 땐 아낌없이 다 내어주었던 상대방이 시간이 지나면서 소홀해지고 싫증 낼 때, ""내 손 가운데 있는 반지 너 줄게""라며 쿨한 모습을 재치 있게 표현한 곡이다. 
작사 우지윤, 안지영 / 작곡 우지윤, 안지영 / 편곡 바닐라맨 
Acoustic guitar 바닐라맨 / Elec guitar 이승엽 / Bass 이동혁 / Chorus 안지영

10. 사랑에 빠졌을 때
친구들은 어리숙한 그녀에게 모두 입을 모아 남자를 조심하라고 한다. 그녀 또한 더 이상 상처받고 싶지 않아 마음의 문을 굳게 닫았지만, 어디선가 살랑살랑 불어오는 바람에 또 한번 마음이 흔들린다. 첫눈에 반한 그와 사랑에 빠졌을 때 폭발적으로 벅차오르는 감성을 팝적인 요소와 함께 리드미컬하게 표현한 곡이다.
작사 : 안지영 / 작곡 : 안지영 / 편곡 : 바닐라맨
Acoustic Guitar : 바닐라맨 / Elec Guitar : 이승엽 / Chorus : 안지영

11. 우주를 줄게 (Radio Edit) (CD Only)
CD를 구입한 팬들을 위해 특별히 마련한 선물로 온라인에는 공개되지 않은 히든 트랙이다. 타이틀곡 ‘우주를 줄게’에서 보컬에 집중하여 편곡한 Radio Edit 버전으로, 원곡과는 또 다른 분위기를 느낄 수 있는 곡이다.

LYRICS: 
I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day, yeah
'Cause all I do is cry behind this smile
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
I-I-It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me",24347,287,0,1,1201587,2014-10-31 07:00:07,1,"Labrinth Official, Labrinth TV, Labyrinth, Labrinth Jealous, Earthquake, Labrinth Earthquake, Emeli Sande, Tinie tempah, The Weeknd, Beneath Your Beautiful, Labrinth beneath your beautiful, Labrinth producer, Let It Be, Labrinth Let It Be, Apple Watch song, Apple Watch Misbehavin, Labrinth Misbehavin, Noah Cyrus Labrinth, Labrinth Losers, Make Me Cry, Labrinth Fragile, X Factor Jealous, American Idol jealous, Jealous of the rain, sia, diplo",Labrinth - Jealous,50VWOBi0VFs,153817321,CJYBEAA,m,0,14,10,31,304,4,8.187005243080266,4.576962971485688,6.0797552210425785,4.386445455747283,8,44,0.2335884353741496,322,0.3,25,0.0,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,18,0.7426103978840425,0.5590521607829898,1.3860323312755796,0,1,3.0

華納音樂和凌時差公司攜手斥資六千萬
打造十支MV十首全主打的十全十美新專輯
2014笑傲華語歌壇超級震撼彈

● I’m Not Yours Feat. 安室奈美惠NAMIE AMURO
2014亞洲樂壇最驚為天人的震撼組合! 亞洲流行天后蔡依林和東洋歌姬安室奈美惠空前跨國攜手合唱曲「I’m Not Yours」! JOLIN首次與國外作曲團隊合作寫歌，也和傳聞已久要合作的安室奈美惠一同合唱，由知名作詞人黃偉文為兩人合唱曲「I’m Not Yours」操刀，藉由JOLIN與安室的影響力一同宣告『做自己的女孩』的Girl Power!
這首是JOLIN親自創作的心頭肉，加上要與安室合作，求好心切的她除了要顧及音樂還得兼顧與安室合作的畫面，製作過程中不斷與製作人Starr Chen反覆討論修改，堪稱磨功一流音樂總監，讓製作人Starr Chen每交出一次修改新版時都會搞笑地說：「我覺得超好聽喔!」希望音樂總監能拍板過關。

Lyrics:
I got a feeling we are gonna win
Our bodies make it perfect
And your eyes can make me swim
Then again everything seems new
I can barely hold my tongue
To say the least I'm into you
And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk and warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs
Are kisses from the outside, girl that's all I need
I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for
I know you don't want
I love you can sing
The music was at the start
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
The rhythm was all
I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart
So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue
The shit we do could warm the sun
And I
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see
I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more
I find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for
I know you don't want
I love you can sing
The music was at the start
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
The rhythm was all
I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
I know you don't want
I love you can sing
The music was at the start
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

Lyrics:
You must think that I’m stupid
You must think that I’m a fool
You must think that I’m new to this
But I have seen this all before

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

I know you’re thinking I’m heartless
I know you’re thinking I’m cold
I’m just protecting my innocence
I’m just protecting my soul

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you 
mean the most to me
‘Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

No...
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you’ll see me cry)
Oh...
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)

‘Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true

Lyrics:
[Hook]
If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because I'm me
Because she said, ""He's the one that drill the charms
Honey let's go wrong""
I just want to know
What's wrong with me?
Being in love with you

[Verse 1: Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah
9th grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
Lost lingo, Bronx's only Django
Snap, he'd got less tougher
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A come back, flat black paint on a Chevy

[Hook]
If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because, I'm, I'm me
Because I'm me
Because I'm me
Because I'm me, I'm me

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Never mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony
Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out baby

[Hook]
I just want to know
What's wrong with me?

[Instrumental]

LYRICS

I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,

Here's the lyrics if you don't feel like watching the video i worked so hard on :-)

If there's a prize for rotten judgement 
I guess I've already won that 
No man is worth the aggravation 
That's ancient history - been there, done that! 

Who'd'ya think you're kiddin' 
He's the Earth and heaven to you 
Try to keep it hidden 
Honey, we can see right through you 
Girl, you can't conceal it 
We know how ya feel and 
Who you're thinking of 

No chance, no way 
I won't say it, no, no 
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it, uh-oh! 
It's too clicha 
I won't say I'm in love 

I thought my heart had learned its lesson 
It feels so good when you start out 
My head is screaming get a grip, girl 
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out 
Oh 

You keep on denying 
Who you are and how you're feeling 
Baby, we're not buying 
Hon, we saw ya hit the ceiling 
Face it like a grown-up 
When ya gonna own up 
That ya got, got, got it bad 

No chance, no way 
I won't say it, no, no 
Give up, give in 
Check the grin you're in love 
This scene won't play 
I won't say I'm in love 

You're doin' flips read our lips 
You're in love 
You're way off base 
I won't say it 
Get off my case 
I won't say it 
Girl, don't be proud 
It's O.K. you're in love

Pretty Girl was inspired by my experiences growing up on social media and being constantly judged and underestimated based on the superficial, which is something I think a lot of girls are going through right now. 

Being on the set of Pretty Girl with all of the amazing girls was so much fun, just hanging out and getting into trouble. We had a good time and I think it shows, especially in the shots outside where we got to be a bit sassier.

I'm feelin the way that I'm feelin myself
Fuck everyone else
gotta remember that nobody's better than anyone else, here

do you need some time to think it over?

Look what they do to you
Look what they do to me
You must be joking if you think that either one is free , here

Get up off your knees girl
Stand face to face with your God
And find out what you are
(Hello my name is Human)
Hello, my name is human
And I came down from the stars
(Hello my name is human)

I'm ready for love and I'm ready for war
But I'm ready for more
I know that nobodies ever been this
Fucking ready before

Do you need some time to think it over

So figure it out or don't  figure it out
I figured it out
The bigger the river
The bigger the drout

Get up off your knees boy
Stand face to face with your god
And find out what you are
(Hello my name is human)
Hello, my name is human
And I came down from the stars
(Hello my name is human)

Fire world I love you
Fireworld

 I'm up off my knees girl
I am face to face with myself 
And I know who I am
And I stole the power from the sun
I am more than just a man
(No longer disillusioned) 

(I'm not asking questions 
cause questions have answers 
and I don't want answers )

I came down from the stars

(So I'll take my chances
And what are the chances 
That I could advance
On my own circumstances
Said what are the chances 
And what are the chances)

Hello my name is human
And I know who I am

(I'm not after answers
I'm not asking questions 
So you keep your answers 
So you keep your answers

#PRISTIN_V #Like_a_V #네_멋대로 #Get_It #20180528_6PM


지난해 2017년 가장 주목받는 신인 걸그룹으로 떠오르며 각종 시상식에서 신인상을 휩쓴 프리스틴이 데뷔 이후 처음으로 유닛을 결성, 프리스틴 V로서 색다른 매력을 가득 담으며 역대급 유닛 탄생을 알렸다.

프리스틴 V 신규 싱글 앨범 ‘Like a V’는‘ 프리스틴 V’처럼 또는 ‘Villain’처럼 “네 멋대로 해봐”라는 의미를 담았다.
타이틀곡 ‘네 멋대로’는 원하는 것을 망설임 없이 얻어내는 자유분방함과 솔직함을 담아낸 메시지가 인상적인 곡으로, 기존에 프리스틴이 시도하지 않았던 래칫 기반의 R&B 팝 장르를 첫 선보이며, 프리스틴 V만의 색다른 분위기와 퍼포먼스를 기대할 수 있는 곡이다.


PRISTIN V's new single album 'Like a V' delivers a message of ""Do as you please"" like PRISTIN V or Villain.

The title 'Get It' is an impressive song expressing free-spirits and honesty earned without hesitation. Ratchet based R&B pop genre is something they have not tried before, so you can definitely look forward to catching the ambiance and the performance from PRISTIN V only.

Lyrics:
Guess I'm Not the one to speak for myself 
And when I needed someone to talk to I never felt 
That the world around is scaring 
To people who are daring
Who never felt the storms going by 

Guess it's time for me to say that I'm alone 
And it's better days for you when I am gone 
No more worries about the future, no money no delusion, no secrets that I never told 

Will you feel my love, will it matter if I'm gone 
And if I made my call, will you hear if I'm wrong 
Do you feel my love, do the days turn to dust
Will I matter if I'm gone, will you ever play my song 

Guess I'm Not to say goodbye 
Write my letter on my shattered mind
Seems like I'm the one to carry all the pieces 
Come to me, my heart is falling down my knees and

No offence but I am hurting like no other 
Cry my tears, I'm crying like the rain in summer 
Catch me while I'm dripping gold and take what you take 
I gave it all since my age, I'm all for you babe

Will you feel my love, will it matter if I'm gone 
And if I made my call, will you hear if I'm wrong 
Do you feel my love, do the days turn to dust

Doña Ubenza, es la canción con la que se iza la bandera de la mujer originaria.
 
La coplera e intérprete Mariana Carrizo presenta el videoclip “Doña Ubenza”, tema del cantautor Chacho Echenique, realizado por EL Birque animaciones - www.elbirque.com , bajo la dirección de Juan Manuel Costa y la animación de Agustín Touriño.
 
Cuenta Mariana “Doña Ubenza vive en todas las mujeres de esta tierra. Era una mujer de la puna de salteña; pastora, hilandera, tejedora, trabajadora de la sal, lavandera entre otros oficios que desempeñaba para criar a sus hijo. Lavaba la ropa en las vertientes, en los pocitos de agua de deshielo, mientras alegre iba cantando coplas que cortaban el frío y la dureza de la suerte de su raza.”
 
Dice Chacho Echenique, el autor de este tema, que cuando era niño su madre fue maestra de escuela y Doña Ubenza cuidaba de él “Nunca más vi una sonrisa tan bonita como la de ella. Era rebosante, tan blanca e inmensa como los salares que estaban a nuestros pies”

Je ne t'aime plus
(Mario Pelchat / Mario Pelchat)

Tu n’as rien vu
Qu’une femme qui voulait te prendre
Tu n’as rien vu
Mes failles mais pas mes gestes tendres
Rien entendu
Quand j’essayais de te comprendre
Damner, condamner tes démons
T’es disparue

Tu n’as rien vu
De l’amour que je respirais
Mon âme à nu
Je l’ai révélée sans regret
Tu n’as rien cru
Tu m’as larguée comme un déchet
Comme on méprise sans raison
Un détenu

Tu n’as rien su
De ma douleur et de mon sang
Qui ne bat plus
Que pour inventer tes serments
Des coins de rue
Où je t’espère où je t’attends
Ta peau, ton corps et ton prénom
Et ça me tue

Il a fallu
Que tu t’éloignes de ma porte
De ma vue
Pour que je laisse une cohorte
D’inconnus
Alimenter mes nuits, mes jours
Pour protéger mon propre amour
Et mon salut

Tu n’as rien vu
Mon souffle et ma voix qui déraillent
Ne donnent plus
Mon cœur qui craignait la chamaille
A survécu
Quand tu m’as livré la bataille
À coups de haine sans pardon
Sans retenue

Je n’ai pas su
Te posséder te retenir
Je n’ai pas su
Trouver la force d’en mourir
Je n’ai pas su
Trouver les mots pour te le dire
Pour en finir et pour de bon
Je ne t’aime plus

Tu l’as cherché tu l’as voulu

Taken from her highly-anticipated debut LP, ""Journey to Golden,"" Chantae melts her whispery warm vocals into the jazz ladened rapture of Da Da 'n Da (released as a gift to us on HER birthday no less!) Together with the Texas-based fusion band, Snarky Puppy, they deliver the equivalent of an aural sunset.

Lyrics:


I don't slip or trip when she asks me where I've been (Where you been?) 
One big smile on my face d-d-darling it's just you and me (you and me) 
Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour, I'll call you back later 
Too many fish in the sea for me 
But when the lights come on and what's her name is gone 
I realise where I'm supposed to be 

I tried to believe every word of your sweet story 
But intuition keeps telling me 
Your making a fool outta me 

'Cos I'm such a good liar 
Just admit it 
I never did it 
Yes you did 
No I didn't
 
I'm playing with fire 
Just admit it 
I never did it 
I know you did it 
No I didn't (yes you did)
 
'Cos I'm such a good liar
(Mr Hudson Ad-Lib) 
I can't help myself I keep playing with fire
(Mr Hudson Ad-Lib)  
(Tulisa Ad-Lib)
Such a good liar 

Thoughts running wild through the night as I watch you sleep (She's getting closer)
I can't help but check his texts while he's passed out next to me (It's only a matter of time) 
I'm on some CSI behaviour, Who's gonna save ya?
You'll be the fool when the truth comes out 
But when those lights come on and what's her face is gone we're straight back to the same routine 
 
I tried to believe every word of your sweet story 
But intuition keeps telling me 
Your making a fool outta me 

'Cos I'm such a good liar 
Just admit it 
I never did it 
Yes you did 
No I didn't

I'm playing with fire 
Just admit it 
I never did it 
I know you did it 
No I didn't (yes you did)
 
'Cos I'm such a good liar 
(Mr Hudson Ad-Lib) 
I can't help myself I keep playing with fire 
(Mr Hudson Ad-Lib) 
(Tulisa Ad-Lib)
Such a good liar 

Living life in disguise
Can't keep up with these lies 
She do anything to try and catch me out 
But I never leave no signs 
In my heart we were meant to be 
Guys like me we be like 2 or 3
Trust 
I can't help myself I love girls (what) 
I get a kick out of playin' with fire 
I get a kick out of playin' with fire 
Playing with fire 
Playing with fire 
She ain't going no where, you know why?

I never did it

歌詞

幽霊になった僕は、明日遠くの君を見に行くんだ その後はどうしよう
きっと君には言えない

幽霊になった僕は、夏の終わり方を見に行くんだ 
六畳の地球で 浅い木陰のバス停で
夜に涼む君の手 誘蛾灯に沿って石を蹴った 
街の薄明かりが揺れている

何も見えなくたって
何も言わなくたって
誰も気付かなくたって
それでもわかるから

君と座って バス停見上げた空が青いことしかわからずに
雲が遠いね ねぇ
夜の雲が高いこと、本当不思議だよ

だからさ、もういいんだよ

幽霊になった僕は、あの頃の景色を見に行くんだ
遠い街の海辺 子供のとき見た露店街
歩き疲れた脚でそこらのベンチでバスを待って
その後はどうしよう
何で歩いてたんだろう

何も知らなくたって
何も聞けなくたって
いつか君が忘れても
それでも見ているから

夏の陰に座って 入道雲を眺めるだけでどこか苦しくて
空が高いよ ねぇ
このままずっと遠くに行けたらいいのにな
夜しかもう眠れずに

君と座って バス停見上げた空が青いことしかわからずに
雲が遠いね ねぇ
夜の雲が高いこと、本当不思議だよ

だからさ、だからさ
君もさ、もういいんだよ

幽霊になった僕は、明日遠くの君を見に行くんだ

Piosenka ""100"" to zwiastun nowej płyty chóru Sound'n'Grace, której premiera planowana jest na listopad 2017. Chór do współpracy zaprosił jednego z najciekawszych i najzdolniejszych uczestników ostatniej edycji The Voice of Poland- Filipa Lato, który również pracuje nad debiutanckim krążkiem.

Życie jest zmienną, warto więc postawić na właściwego konia - na wartości, relacje, wewnętrzny spokój. Nie na gonitwę, walkę o więcej, kupowanie kolejnych rzeczy i najgorszy ze wszystkich - strach. On jest szczególnie złym doradcą, bo zabiera nasz potencjał. Liczą się małe radości, wiara w wewnętrzne prowadzenie i codzienne Sprawdzam. Pytajmy siebie codziennie: czy dziś żyłem / żyłam na 100 %, na 50%, na 10%? Czy tak chcę, czy jutro spróbuję inaczej? O tym jest piosenka 100. 
Chcieliśmy by była pozytywna i by motywowała do zmiany, do cieszenia się z małych rzeczy i ustalenia właściwych priorytetów.

0,Tommaso Cimino,331,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"J'ai voulu te revoir...

Je n'aurais jamais cru, qu'on se rencontrerait:
Le hasard est curieux, il provoque les choses
Et le destin pressé, un instant prend la pause.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié.

Je souris malgré moi, rien qu'à te regarder:
Si les mois les années, marquent souvent les êtres
Toi, tu n'as pas changé... La coiffure peut-être.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié, rien oublié.

Marié, moi? Allons donc! Je n'en ai nulle envie -
J'aime ma liberté, et puis de toi à moi,
Je n'ai pas rencontré, la femme de ma vie,
Mais allons prendre un verre et parle moi de toi.

Que fais-tu de tes jours? Es-tu riche et comblée?
Tu vis seule à Paris, mais alors ce mariage?
Entre nous, tes parents ont dû crever de rage.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié.

Qui m'aurais dit qu'un jour, sans l'avoir provoqué,
Le destin, tout à coup, nous mettrait face à face?
Je croyais que tout meurt, avec le temps qui passe.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié.

Je ne sais trop que dire ni par où commencer.
Les souvenirs foisonnent, envahissent ma tête
Et mon passé revient du fond de sa défaite.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié, rien oublié.

À l'âge où je portais que mon coeur pour toute arme,
Ton père ayant pour toi, bien d'autres ambitions
A brisé notre amour et fait jaillir nos larmes
Pour un mari choisi, sur sa situation.

J'ai voulu te revoir, mais tu étais cloîtrée.
Je t'ai écris cent fois, mais toujours sans réponse.
Cela m'a pris longtemps avant que je renonce.
Non, je n'ai rien oublié.

SEULEMENT PARLÉ:
L'heure court et, déjà, le café va fermer.
Viens, oui viens je te raccompagne à travers les rues mortes
Comme au temps des baisers qu'on volait sous ta porte.
Non, non je n'ai rien oublié.
Chaque saison était notre saison.
Oui mais nous ne redoutions ni l'hiver ni l'automne.
C'est toujours le printemps, quand nos vingt ans résonnent.
Non, non, je n'ai rien oublié, rien oublié.

CHANTÉ:
Cela m'a fait du bien, de sentir ta présence.
Je me sens différent, comme un peu plus léger.
On a souvent besoin, d'un bain d'adolescence.
C'est doux de revenir au sources du passé.

Je voudrais, si tu veux, sans vouloir te forcer,
Te revoir à nouveau, enfin si c'est possible,
Si tu en as envie, si tu es disponible.

Si tu n'as rien oublié,
Comme moi, qui n'ai rien oublié...",157,393,0,0,5285,2009-05-28 18:35:08,0,"Aznavour, Charles Aznavour, Non je n'ai rien oublié, chanson d'amour, chanson française","Charles Aznavour - Non, je n'ai rien oublié (with lyrics)",_1EMN7M0vaY,2466507,CJYBEAA,n,0,9,5,28,148,3,6.392082352337004,2.5198279937757193,3.723044991643445,2.1958996524092336,6,22,0.0,352,0.0,4,0.0,9,0,3,1,1,0,3,0,0,2,5,1,0,3,0,4,3,0,0,4,2,1,2,1,1,0,1,1,57,0.582446343214315,0.3942108150178082,1.6954531540449502,0,0,3.0

Music: N°005 (remastered) from the album “Season 1""(by relaxdaily)

This is slow and peaceful instrumental music you can use e.g. in your studying, calm music or relaxation music playlist. A smooth instrumental tune, not too demanding, good for your mind to free up creative or mental resources, or simply to relax!

In the video, you look at a nature spot that I was able to capture during a trip to the Swiss Alps earlier this summer. I spent only one day in a region called Parc Ela and was pretty lucky to end up at this little lake called Palpuognasee (Lake Palpuogna). It’s the same place that I featured in my recent video relaxdaily N°003 (https://youtu.be/Lz8H2-dqzt0) as well. Hope a little of the positive energy this place radiates comes through to you right now while you watch and listen ;)

Enjoy,
Good energy to you,

...relaxdaily's instrumental background music: beautiful, light, peaceful and positive music that can be used as a soundtrack for multiple activities. Depending on your interest you might use my music in your relax radio playlist, as yoga music, as spa & wellness music, as meditation music, as music while you're studying, learning, doing homework, working (possibly mentally, creatively), reading, writing, gaming, while thinking or reflecting, dreaming, reviewing, making future plans, coding, inventing, changing society or systems for the better, or simply to fill the air with a positive vibe.
Some use it as ""sleep music"" (I personally think there's better sleep, or ""sleep aid"" music out there, but it seems to work... and sure, a good sleep IS a good foundation of a healthy lifestyle ;) Call it chill-out, smooth, ambient, New Age, healing, inspirational, instrumental, or background music - this is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With the relaxdaily project, I try to take a little heat from our (generally) too busy lives.
My mission is to deliver a soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm, good energy tunes.

Lyrics:

Her skin is like satin
It looks so smooth and white
Her eyes like black coffee
Are all I need tonight

She's wearing a long dress tonight
I don t know what's hiding inside
And I know they say that less is more
But I want to love her so

Amor amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana
Canta Copacabana, con mi quitarra, con mi quitarra
Amor amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana
You know you make me wanna, you make me wanna

Have you heard about this pretty girl
With a naughty smile how they call her
Has a golden hair, like a fairytale

Everyone is watching her tonight
I will try my best I won't be shy
If I get a dance
I will take my chance

She's wearing a long dress tonight
I don't know what's hiding inside
And I know they say that less is more
But I want to love her so

Amor amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana
Canta Copacabana, con mi quitarra, con mi quitarra

The obsessive trait became at an early age from what would seem like truthfabrics bleeding through the cracks between cellwalls, alive in vast nothingnesses surrounding scarce specifics of illusional matter that would float in brightness excesses, ascending to unflinching gaze-in as quest that became to level the endless plains in sight as unified with the fluid surfaces of the endoplasmic waves.""",2,896,0,0,95,2013-05-06 02:25:12,0,"Dark Buddha Rising, Dakhmandal, Svart Records, Stoner Rock, Doom Metal, Psychedelic Rock, Noisy, Noise Rock, Ritual","Dark Buddha Rising - N (New Track, 2013)",DKlIED1iPRo,12804,CPoBEAA,n,0,13,5,6,126,0,4.107345665472095,0.4771212547196624,1.977723605288848,0.3010299956639812,4,19,0.032499999999999994,148,-0.15,8,-0.006818181818181821,7,0,3,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,40,0.4815089272652026,0.11616291726565033,6.569855608330947,0,0,3.0

Lyrics:
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time...on my 
own Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ohhh yeahhh
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

0,KeithTheKing,2536,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Arrows, ""I Love Rock N Roll"" featuring lead singer Alan Merrill. The original a-side version from 1975 by the band (Alan Merrill and) the Arrows. The group were produced by British legend Mickie Most, and the tune was written by Arrows Alan Merrill and Jake Hooker. The song was later covered by Joan Jett, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and many more. Lead vocals & bass guitar by Alan Merrill, guitar & backing vocals by Jake Hooker, and drums and backing vocals by Paul Varley. 
The Arrows released both an a-side version and a b-side version of this particular song.
Having their own TV series, the band recorded many versions of their songs for performance on the show, in accordance with musician's union rules at the time. 
The video was made in three locations. The park is Berkeley Square, London England, W1, the street scenes are on Charles Street, same area. The performance was filmed on Quay Street in Manchester England, at the Granada/ITV studios.
This clip aired on Granada/ITV in 1976, produced by Muriel Young and directed by Peter Walker.
This version is available on The Arrows ""Tawny Tracks"" rarities album.
There have been many different recording bands named the Arrows over decades, on separate continents, so in order to keep focus and clarity I have made sure people know this is the Arrows fronted by lead singer Alan Merrill in the headline above.
Clip trivia: The mystery man standing by the tree with the Arrows at the end of this clip is Monsieur Kamayatsu of the legendary Japanese band The Spiders.
Cosmic oddity: Arrows singer Alan Merrill and Joan Jett are both left handed, but play their instruments right handed.
More trivia- Joan Jett was initially introduced to her manager Kenny Laguna by a tv producer named Alan Sacks. Arrows singer Alan Merrill's legal birth name is Allan Sachs, same pronounciation. A little eerie, don't you think?

This record was recorded with an Nagaoka MP10 cartridge with 3,5mm 78rpm stylus as well as 78rpm phono preamp. The restoration was done as truthfully as possible.
The second version of ""Hoch drob' n auf dem Berg"" performed by Adalbert Lutter is a more uptempo version when compared to the Munsonius recording featured in the previous video.  

As with the Munsonius recording the vocals are provided by the excellent Schuricke Terzett. 

Adalbert Lutter is a somewhat overlooked bandleader  - probably because of the very large amount of records he made while under contract to Telefunken. Another reason may be that while his recordings are generally good - few of them are extraordinary....yet sometimes he surprises us. I especially like this version of ""Hoch droben auf dem Berg""

0,MaxRaabeVEVO,162,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Mit Fahrrad fahr'n hat Max Raabe den Kanon der deutschen Radfahrlieder, um neue 140 Beats per Minute ergänzt. Diese schnellste, neue Raabe-Nummer, muss so schnell sein, denn „Max Raabe“, sagt Mit-Autor Achim Hagemann, „ist eben auch ein schneller Radfahrer.“ Die Erweiterung seines Autoren- und Produzententeams um Peter Plate, Ulf Leo Sommer, Daniel Faust und eben Achim Hagemann hat Raabes Genre nicht verändert, sie hat ihm ein Fenster geöffnet. Eine Brise Pop kam herein und legte sich mit Klanghölzern und Steeldrum über die gewohnt, perfekte Orchestrierung des Palast Orchesters. Das Album, das mit einem leichten Vibraphon beginnt und in einem 30-köpfigen Streichorchester gipfelt, klingt nach Sommer dem man mit dieser Single besonders schnell entgegen radeln möchte.

Porque você evita até meu nome
Tô precisando tanto de você

Escuta
É que eu não sei amar pela metade
Eu quero alguém que ame de verdade
Não vou chorar de novo por você

Eu mudei
Mudei porquê não posso ficar longe de você
Quero te olhar nos olhos e te fazer perceber
Que a vida só importa se você tiver comigo

Eu não sei
Eu já quebrei a cara acreditando em você
To me recuperando
E o que eu quero é viver
É melhor daqui pra frente ser somente amigo

Para com isso perdoa o meu jeito
Eu não sou perfeito mais amo você
Diz que me aceita
Que a gente se ajeita

Eu só te aceito se for do meu jeito
Se você quiser vai ter que ser assim
Então ta combinado

""Snow (Hey Oh)"" Lyrics:

Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go.

Shot at ""Pub 18"", Gevelsberg, Germany.

Lyrics: 

I was roving out one evening as I came down to Portlaw
I walked into a dim lit pub and suddenly I saw
Her cheeks they were so rosy and golden was her hair
She had to be an Irish girl ‘cause she looked so god damn fair

She took me by her lovely hand and whispered in my ear
I`ll guide you up to heaven If you’ll order me a beer
Seconds later I find myself aside this pretty lass
Wanton thoughts in my head and an ale in my glass

Hey dear, common won’t you spend another two
One for me and one for you 
The truth is she will fill you up and ask you to pay
But I drink my pint and say “fuck off“ ’cause thats my Irish way

When I was a little drunk I went to take a piss
When I came back I saw two girls having a French kiss
The girls they waved me nearer could this really be
The Irish way is finally dawning on me

When we drank our final pint, the girls asked me to pay
They promised me to meet outside at Lower Castles way
And when they left I took the bill, the girls had set me up
They left me with an empty purse and sick to the gut",523,292,0,0,14660,2018-06-25 11:47:28,0,"Irish Way, The O'Reillys and the Paddyhats, Paddyhats, O'Reillys, Irish Folk, Irish Folk Punk, Celtic, Ireland, Two Girls, Kissing, Irish Pub, Tourist, Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, Fiddler's Green, Mr. Irish Bastard, O'Reilly Open Air, Music, Music Video, Musikvideo, Celtic Music, Folk Rock, Kiss, Screw Up, Pub18, Gevelsberg, Germany, Wüstenberg und Römer, Wüstenberg & Römer, Barrels of Whiskey, Fair Old Lady, Black Sails, Session, Guinness, Beer, Fiddle",Irish Way - The O'Reillys and the Paddyhats [Official Video],c2bEwZR7g1Y,1433977,CDIQAA,o,0,18,6,25,176,0,6.156542185604312,2.492760389026837,4.1661339703051095,2.7185016888672737,6,26,-0.011616783599542223,243,0.043333333333333335,35,0.0,9,0,5,0,1,4,4,2,0,4,5,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,60,0.6767003042790278,0.4048961761125581,1.5325110840894953,0,0,3.0

Lyrics:
O Fortuna
velut luna
statu variabilis,
semper crescis
aut decrescis;
vita detestabilis
nunc obdurat
et tunc curat
ludo mentis aciem,
egestatem,
potestatem
dissolvit ut glaciem.

Sors immanis
et inanis,
rota tu volubilis,
status malus,
vana salus
semper dissolubilis,
obumbrata
et velata
michi quoque niteris;
nunc per ludum
dorsum nudum
fero tui sceleris.

Sors salutis
et virtutis
michi nunc contraria,
est affectus
et defectus
semper in angaria.
Hac in hora
sine mora
corde pulsum tangite;
quod per sortem
sternit fortem,
mecum omnes plangite!



English translation:
O Fortune,
like the moon
you are changeable,
ever waxing
and waning;
hateful life
first oppresses
and then soothes
as fancy takes it;
poverty
and power
it melts them like ice.

Fate -- monstrous
and empty,
you whirling wheel,
you are malevolent,
well-being is vain
and always fades to nothing,
shadowed
and veiled
you plague me too;
now through the game
I bring my bare back
to your villainy.

Fate is against me
in health
and virtue,
driven on
and weighted down,
always enslaved.
So at this hour
without delay
pluck the vibrating strings;
since Fate
strikes down the strong man,
everyone weep with me!",1142,226,0,0,33682,2011-09-13 07:43:11,0,"André Rieu, O Fortuna, Carl Orff, Carmina Burana, Live, Amsterdam, Arena, Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi, World Stadium Tour, Mirusia Louwerse, Kalki Schrijvers, soloist, soloists, tenors, Carmina Burana (Orff)",André Rieu - O Fortuna (Carl Orff - Carmina Burana),4QPU1VpPn2s,4886538,CGQQAA,o,0,11,9,13,256,1,6.689001280396018,3.0153597554092144,4.527397871520467,3.0576661039098294,6,37,-0.027444083694083687,168,0.13636363636363635,14,0.0,9,0,6,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,4,1,0,0,6,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,51,0.6768421296000148,0.4507937177776548,1.4806711124315686,0,0,3.0

[ SF9 ]
 
From the ambitious boys in its debut song ‘Fanfare’ to outburst of youth in ‘Roar’ to the broken hearted boys in ‘Easy Love’, a beloved group SF9 of its charm transcending the boundary between boys and men has released its third mini album ‘Knights of the Sun’

The title track of ‘Knights of the Sun’ is ‘O Sole Mio’, which means ‘oh my sun.’ This song describes a story about members of SF9 as nine knights guarding the sun going to find the lost sun. The song has become more mature but still has innocence of the boys pursuing ideals.

SÍ O NO (FEAT. MALUMA) - LYRICS

Si quieres jugar, ven
Tienes que arriesgarte
Va a ser Sí o No

Y TÚ LO SABES QUE ME GUSTAS 
DALE
MUEVE EL CUERPO SUAVE

BAILAME QUE QUIERO VERTE

PERO VOY A DISFRUTARTE 

SOLO TÚ, TÚ, TÚ ME ENLOQUECES 
Y SOLO TÚ TÚ TÚ TE MERECES
QUE TE DIGA AL OÍDO
LAS COSAS QUE ME EXCITAN
LO QUE EL NIÑO NECESITA, BABY 
 
Solo mira y desea
Más te gusta, lo demuestras
Quiero ver si tú puedes aguantar
Toda la noche sin tocar ni besar

Yo me muevo, te enloquezco
Solo aplaude, lo merezco
Quiero ver si tú puedes aguantar
Toda la noche sin tocar ni besar

Todo puede suceder
Tienes que pagar pa ver si va a pasar
Yo quiero ver
Tal vez sea diversión
Baby, pero mi intención no voy a decir 
Ven a descubrir

SI QUIERES JUGAR, VEN 
QUE QUIERO TOCARTE  
Y AQUÍ MISMO DÁRTELO 
NO DIGAS QUE NO

BAILAME QUE QUIERO VERTE

Vas a aguantar la presión
Mucha presión
Mi intención es seducción

SOLO TÚ, TÚ, TÚ ME ENLOQUECES 
Y SOLO TÚ TÚ TÚ TE MERECES

Sé que tú quieres “si""
Pero puede ser “no""

Felizes, de uma maneira geral, geral
Estamos vivos
Aqui agora brilhando com um cristal
Somos luzes
Que faíscam no caos
E vozes abrindo um grande canal

Nós estamos na linha do tiro
Caçando os dias em horas vazias
Vizinhos do cão
Mas sempre rindo e cantando
Nunca em vão

Uma doce família
Que tem a mania
De achar alegria
Motivo e razão
Onde dizem que não
Aí que tá a mágica, meu irmão

Tá aqui e agora
No ar que rodeia
No som que nos cerca
No olho que vê
E não consegue tocar
Aí que tá o segredo, meu irmão

Que pulsa no peito
Que sente e não julga
Que tira do sério
E ascende um na cidade
E não dá pra explicar
Aí que tá o mistério, meu irmão

Eh
Descobrir o que liberta o sol
Que faz buraco
Furação do escuro, escuro, escura
Esquecer ao menos uma noite
O medo, o mal real
Que te segura

Nós estamos na linha do tiro
Caçando os dias em horas vazias
Vizinhos do cão
Mas sempre rindo e cantando
Nunca em vão

Que tem a mania
De achar alegria
Motivo e razão
Onde dizem que não
Aí que tá a mágica, meu irmão

Leve e auto-reverse
Plugado no peito
Mostrando outro jeito
Batendo de frente
Com o bicho feroz, com o bicho feroz

Leve e auto-reverse
Plugado no peito
Mostrando outro jeito
Batendo de frente
Com o bicho feroz, com o bicho feroz

Pense quanto impulso
Vem de tudo ao seu redor, seu redor
Pense tudo quanto
Pode ser melhor, ser melhor

In a recent, exclusive track-by-track feature with Metal Hammer, vocalist Mikael Åkerfeldt gave some insight behind the creation of the song: “It’s a song inspired by “Dun Ringil”l by Jethro Tull (from the album Stormwatch, 1979). I wanted to do a song with my capo really high, so it’s up on the fifth fret. It makes the guitar sound really glittery. I just wanted to go for a simple, catchy vocal melody. It has a slightly positive vibe to it, but the lyrics are really, really dark. It’s a beautiful song, I think. I’m really happy with that one.”

2016 marks the monumental return of one of heavy rock’s most unique, revered and fearless bands of the last three decades, Opeth. Over the years, the experimental, prog veterans have continuously reinvented themselves, pushing the boundaries of their craft and expectations of fans and critics alike.

OPETH’s new album, Sorceress, their first for Nuclear Blast via the band’s imprint label Moderbolaget Records, is proof chief architect Mikael Åkerfeldt has a near-endless well of greatness inside. From the album’s opener 'Persephone' to 'The Wilde Flowers' and 'Strange Brew' to the album’s counterpart title tracks 'Sorceress' and 'Sorceress II', OPETH’s twelfth full-length is an unparalleled adventure, where visions cleverly and secretly change, colors mute as if weathered by time, and sounds challenge profoundly.

Sorceress Track List:
1. Persephone
2. Sorceress
3. The Wilde Flowers
4. Will O The Wisp
5. Chrysalis
6. Sorceress 2
7. The Seventh Sojourn
8. Strange Brew
9. A Fleeting Glance
10. Era
11. Persephone (Slight Return)

”The new album ""Sorceress"" is our 12th studio album since our beginnings in 1990,” says Åkerfeldt. “I find it difficult to understand that we’ve been going on for 26 years, let alone that we’ve made 12 records now, all of which I am very proud of. ”Sorceress” is no exception. I love this album, as does the whole band. I wrote the music during 5-6 months and we spent only 12 days recording it at Rockfield studios in Wales. I find that once again we’ve taken a step forward. Or sideways, Or backwards. Somewhere!? It’s different! It’s extremely diverse. And if I may say so myself, extremely good. I feel the right to say that since I like to think I know this band better than anyone on the planet. Also, I always manage to detach myself from the record and listen as a fan. It’s a fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That’s how it should be, right? It’s both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. Just the way we like it. Hopefully there’ll be others around the globe sharing this opinion. It was a joy to make it. A fucking joy to record it, and a sheer joy listening to it. So there you have it!”

For Sorceress, OPETH returned to Rockfield Studios in Wales, also home to pivotal releases from Queen, Rush and Judas Priest, where the Swedes had tracked Pale Communion in 2014 with Tom Dalgety. The band spent 12 days recording at the countryside venue among its serene and inspiring surroundings. The result is nothing short of a powerful and intriguing record that will add yet another layer to the band’s celebrated career.

Baba O'Riley was released on 1971 classic album Who's Next. The title is derived from the combination of the song's philosophical and musical influences, Meher Baba and Terry Riley, and describes the scenes Pete Townshend witnessed during the Who's legendary performance at the Woodstock Festival.

Lyrics:

Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living.

I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south cross land
Put out the fire
And don't look past my shoulder.

The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older.

Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland.
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
Its only teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!

Lyrics:

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uhh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (uhh)
And I was hoping...

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it
Cause you've been waiting on me since
I said that I was hittin' the club
Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts saying
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love",11935,287,0,1,395961,2011-09-29 20:34:40,1,"dirty, epiphany, acoustic, t pain 5 o clock, happy hour, music, im in love with a stripper, t pain vevo, instrumental, wiz khalifa, t pain, hip hop, clean, vevo, TPainVevo, 5 o clock official, lily allen, thr33 ringz, 5 o clock live, official, 5 O'Clock, greatest hits, download, revolver, t pain official, karaoke, remix, rap, channel, t pain live, t pain lyrics, lyrics, audio, in the morning, official video, cover, 2015, rappa turnt sanga, hq","T-Pain - 5 O'Clock ft.

Lyrics:

Forgive her for she knows not what she does

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying God, man full of pain
When will you come again?
Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees

No forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally?

For her lust, she'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

(Corpus Christi)
She needs
(Corpus Christi, corpus Christi)

(Corpus Christi)
She needs
(Corpus Christi, corpus Christi)

(Body of Christ)
She needs
(Body of Christ, body of Christ)

She'd like to know God
Ooh, love God
Feel her God
Inside of here, deep inside of her

She'd like to know God

Deixa eu perguntar uma coisa

...
Quem cala consente
Eu acho que deu pra entender.
A minha mão já não tá mais na sua
A gente anda pela rua separados
Nem parecemos namorados
Aliança virou enfeite de dedo
A nossa cama agora é só pra dormir mesmo
E no carro parece que eu tô levando um simples passageiro

Amante Não Tem Lar [ Letra ]
Composição: Marília Mendonça / Juliano Tchula

Só vim me desculpar
Eu não vou demorar
Não vou tentar ser sua amiga
Pois sei que não dá

Você vai me odiar
Mas eu vim te contar
Que faz um tempo 
Eu me meti no meio do seu lar

Sua família é tão bonita
Eu nunca tive isso na vida
E se eu continuar assim 
Eu sei que não vou ter 

Ele te ama de verdade
E a culpa foi minha 
Minha responsabilidade eu vou resolver
Não quero atrapalhar você

E o preço que eu pago
É nunca ser amada de verdade
Ninguém me respeita nessa cidade
Amante não tem lar
Amante nunca vai casar

E o preço que eu pago
É nunca ser amada de verdade
Ninguém me respeita nessa cidade
Amante não vai ser fiel
Amante não usa aliança e véu

PRIORIDADE

Filho sem intimidade comigo
Não há como você vencer!
Sem dobrar os seus joelhos
E na madrugada me buscar

Sem examinar as Escrituras
Não há como descobrir os segredos
Que tenho pra você

Mas sondei seu coração 
E vi desejo de adorar
Foi pensando então que decidi me revelar
E lhe mostrar alguns segredos para uma vida
De vitória e de conquista

Escuta o que eu vou lhe dizer:
Filho, enquanto eu for sua prioridade
Pode vir o que vier
Pode também contar comigo
Seja lá para o que for

Mil cairão ao seu lado e dez mil a sua direita
Mas você não será atingido, verá livramento
Sou eu,  o Seu Deus!

Se lhe fecharem uma porta, outra pra você eu abrirei
De preferência onde não tem parede
Só pra mostrar sou Deus de sua vida
Sou Deus da sua história

E ninguém irá sentar à mesa
Enquanto de glória eu não lhe honrar!

ABOUT THE VIDEO: 

We’ve written many a song about our hometown of Sydney, and ‘A Fistful O’ Roses’ is yet another, though this one was created beneath a very dark cloud & a sorely difficult time for our beloved city.
 
An agenda of sweeping law reforms and increasingly heavy tactics by our state government have crushed the city’s nightlife, the livelihood, and in many cases even the lives of many of its inhabitants. Iconic pubs, bars & restaurants are forced to close their doors, elderly residents are driven from their homes and Sydney is growing more desperate & hostile with every passing day.
 
This is a city under siege by those who rule her, set to become a playground for the elite, while the people who made it the treasure it was are squeezed out to wherever they hell they may venture.
 
We performed the video for the song as a macabre ‘dry wake’, set among the decay, in a derelict pub, one of many to fall victim to the states new order. Historic footage flits across the screen like memories of a life flashing before one’s eyes. ‘A Fistful O’ Roses’ is one last great send-off for the old girl, but make no mistake..
 
..this is a band falling very much out of love with its muse.

LYRICS: 

Oh I’ve loved you from afar, I’ve borne you like a scar,
Sung your name across the bloody Colfiorito,
But a poison took your heart, you charmless little tart,
Now you’ve nary a jot o’ bother at all for me-o,
This old town has gone to bits, all the folk are off their tits,
Screamin’,  “Hoo-rah! Hurry the fuck t’blazes!”
A right parade o’ fools come to stomp all o’er yer jewels,
Like a fistful o’ half dead roses.

And we’re here again, ho again, let the whisky flow again,
Let the taps blow again, sound away the knell,
Like a fistful o’ roses, we’ll take ‘em to the grave,
Every last tale there is to tell.

Oh, this boozer is a wreck, all up & down the deck,
Like a tired old sinner off her game,
Wi’ her blood red lips, and her youth about her hips,
Still the regulars all love her just the same,
Where the mud-spat boots cut their way among the suits,
And the Sally’s come to rattle the can for Jesus,
‘Til they chain up all the doors & toss out all the whores, 
Wi’ a fistful o’ half dead roses.

May all the Autumn leaves turn to Twenties at yer feet,
And the high & mighty come to know your thunder,
We could set the world ablaze, but these are early days,
And there’s still a hell of a road for us tae wander,
And there’s one here among us’ll outlive the rest,
Take a tipple to his foibles & his praises,
‘Til they strike him off the roll & chuck him doon a hole,
Wi’ a fistful o’ half dead roses.

O que veio fazer aqui? Se quer me ouvir vou te dizer:
A verdade de tudo que você queria saber,
Não sou culpado pelos seus erros.

Quem diria que um dia os papeis iam se inverter,
E não toque mais no nome dela não tem nada haver,
Suas coisas já deixei lá fora já pode ir embora.

Vou dizer o que ela tem que não tem em você,
Senta ai e escuta calada e vê se não chora,
Ela quis o amor que um dia você jogou fora!

Foi ela quem pegou na minha mão quando você soltou,
Foi ela quem me aceitou do jeito que eu sou,
Do jeito que você deixou.

Foi ela quem me ajudou a levantar quando eu cai,
Foi ela enxugou as minhas lágrimas, me fez sorrir.
Ela me aceitou do jeito que eu sou,
E é com ela que eu estou.

TEKST UTWORU:
Normalnie o tej porze - wożę się po mieście 
Normalnie o tej porze - raz lepiej raz gorzej 
Zazwyczaj - jak żaba skaczę z miejsca na miejsce 
Dzisiaj to nie przejdzie - do domu wrócę wcześniej 
Wczoraj... 
Przy fajce i butelce, po którą... 
Trzeba stać w kolejce 
Było więcej kobiet - wszystkie były piękne 
Tak... lepiej jak jest więcej 

Może by coś dzisiaj, ale ja umywam ręce 
Prędzej do domu pędzę niż w M5 BeEmCe
Pięknej koleżance, w pięknej sukience 
Mówię ""PA"", chwytam kierownicę jak Zorro lejce 
Numeromania na liczniku, 
Sam sobie komentuje to co w radioodbiorniku 
Niedługo będę w domu, nic nie pokrzyżuje moich szyków 
Za parę minut zaparkuję przy chodniku 

Normalnie o tej porze - wożę się po mieście 
Normalnie o tej porze - raz lepiej raz gorzej 
Normalnie o tej porze - wożę się jak bożek 
Normalnie o tej porze - raz lepiej, raz gorzej 

Jakoś niechcący - złapałem za cybuch gorący 
Wykonałem wdech tępy, żar mi wpadł do gęby 
Wyplułem od razu, niefartownie 
Bo spadł mi na spodnie i na szybkości 
Miałem dziurę o wielkości dwuzłotówki 
Nie palę dziś już z lufki, nie palę dziś już wcale 
Wieczór długi jak korale, a ja wciąż zmieniam lokale 
Za oknami migają latarnie, jadę dalej 
Coś się dzisiaj bawię marnie, 
Czerwona fala jechać ciągle nie pozwala 
Z dala ktoś podbiega - to dalszy mój kolega 
Stuka w szybkę, wsiada szybko, gadką męczy płytką 
I mówi dziwnym tonem - cóż wiszę mu kabonę 
- Hej Peperoni skręć w lewą stronę 
Ja tutaj z tyłu w piwie tonę, bo było wzburzone 
I jakby tego było mało - kurewsko się rozpadało 
Oprócz domówki nic już z planów nie zostało 
Nic już z planów nie zostało 

Normalnie o tej porze - wożę jak bożek 
Normalnie o tej porze - raz lepiej raz gorzej 
Normalnie o tej porze - wożę jak bożek 
Normalnie o tej porze - raz lepiej, raz gorzej 
Normalanie o tej porze ...
To normalne o tej porze - raz lepiej, raz gorzej 
A normalnie o tej porze wożę się jak bożek 
To jest normalne o tej porze - raz lepiej raz gorzej 
Bo to normalne o tej porze 

Wsiadaj - jedziemy 
Na transporter się złożę, muzyka forte 
Jak zazwyczaj o tej porze 
Noc ciemna jak porter, porter szumi jak morze 
Szumi też coś tam w zielonym kolorze 
Tak ... dziś będę pasażerem 
Dziś w domu chciałem wcześniej być 
Intencje miałem szczere, dziś spędzam dobrze 
Sobotę - będę na niedziele 
Nie będzie kłopotów z powrotem - są przyjaciele 
Są przyjaciele, są przyjaciele, są przyjaciele 
Są przyjaciele, są przyjaciele, są przyjaciele

Mark O'Connor Grammy nominated Heroes recording featuring 14 of his violin and fiddle playing heroes was released in 1992. The sequel to the original ""Devil Comes Back to Georgia"" was done here with an all star cast. Mark O'Connor plays Johnny's fiddle solo and Marty Stuart is the voice of Johnny.

Charlie Daniels plays the Devil's fiddle solo and Travis Tritt is the voice of the Devil. Johnny Cash is the narrator who recalls this epic duel, ""The Devil Comes Back to Georgia"".


REVIEW: ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" has long been a crowd pleaser since Charlie Daniels first unleashed it on the world 25 years ago. The musical folktale of the boy fiddler, Johnny, and his encounter with the Devil is a satisfying one because our hero, Johnny, whips the Devil in a fiddling contest, saving his soul and gaining a golden fiddle. Mark approached Charlie Daniels about doing a ""sequel"" and Charlie agreed, stipulating only that the Devil must lose again. Johnny Cash, the man in black himself, performs the ""narration"" of the sequel while Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt perform the parts of Johnny and The Devil, and when Mark plays the final fiddle showdown it's as if Paganini has risen from the grave to steal his soul from the Devil one more time. If you're a betting man or woman, and you have a choice in a fiddle contest between Charlie Daniels, The Devil, and Mark O'Connor - put all your money on Mark O'Connor."" -Mark J. Fowler

Lyrics:

I dance around this empty house
Tear us down
Throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinning all around and now we fall

Pictures framing up the past
Your taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle
Now a rash

This used to be a funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down down down

Hoooly moly I think it has been at least 3 years since I tried doing something Jazzy, hasn't it? Let me just say these new plugins I got have enabled me to do other styles a lot better than I used to be able to, since I actually have the right sounds for them now and it's really nice. Anyway, I'm really hoping Diamond and Pearl remakes are on the horizon soon, since even thought I started with RSE, DPPT were the games that really got me into pokemon and I would say I had the fondest of memories with so Sinnoh is a pretty big deal for me. I'm hoping to do some more Sinnoh stuff on my free time but at the moment I have commissions to do which I will be making an announcement about that soon discussing new prices and terms and all that good stuff. Regardless I hope you enjoy this!

There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die

0,The Schubert Club,1,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"The Schubert Club Student Scholarship Competition, held each spring, awards a total of over $50,000 annually to young musicians to be used for further musical education.

The competition began in 1922, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Schubert Club. It started modestly with three winners representing the categories of voice, violin, and piano.  The competition has since grown to fourteen different categories with two cash prizes awarded for each category – $2000 and $1500 – to be used for further musical education. The winners of each category are also invited to perform in the annual Winners Recital. 

The Competition is named in memory of Bruce P. Carlson, Executive Director of Schubert Club from 1968 to 2006.

Applicants must be a resident or enrolled in a learning institution within the 5-state region (MN, WI, SD, ND or IA). 

Applications are accepted starting in October of each year with a deadline of January, and the competition takes place in February and March.

Lyrics:

Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you

At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I reallyhate you,
So much, I think it must be

True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love,

Letra Feliz consumismo :

Consume excesivamente sin necesitar,
malgasta tu dinero en esta sociedad,
busca y encuentra en ello tu felicidad,
en fiestas inmombrables como navidad,
compra y requete compra sin reflexionar,
hazte de un buen coche para aparentar,
con grandes amistades que te apoyaran,
mientras tu bolsillo este a reventar,
consumir por curiosidad es consumo experimental,
necesidad no permanente consumo ocasional,
actividad cotidiana consumo habitual,
consumo privado o publico de la sociedad,
cuanto mas consumes mas feliz estas,
cualquier articulo o producto te hara mejorar,
tu cara tu cuerpo y tu actividad,
gimnasio pilates y la presion social,
cremas desodorantes de alta calidad,
ropa de altas marcas para destacar,
alimentos saturados sin desperdiciar,
programas basuras que te engancharan.

Darle las gracias a DFBeats por la inspiración de su beat.

LYRICS 

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I’ll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we’ve got a lot of problems.

You know where I’m coming,
From though I am running,
To you, all I feel is deny, deny, denial,
I wanted to be a better brother, better son,
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done,
I have none to show to the one I love,
But deny, deny, denial.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I’ll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we’ve got a lot of problems.

Polarize is taking your disguises,
Separating them, splitting them up from wrong and right,
It’s deciding where to die and deciding where to fight,
Deny, deny, denial.

I wanted to be a better brother, better son,
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done,
I have none to show to the one I love,
But deny, deny, denial.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I’ll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we’ve got a lot of problems.

Domingo en fuego, I think I lost my halo,
I don’t know where you are,
You’ll have to come and find me, find me.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I have problems.

Friends are happy for me
Or they’re honeysuckle phonies
They celebrate my medals
Or they wanna take my trophies  
Some are loyal soldiers
While these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me, you’ll be lonely oh

LYRICS

All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
We could go anywhere we could do
Anything girl whatever the mood we're in
All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are your lips

They pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching I don't mind ‘cause

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I’m with you

I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go that they do
Feelings they come and they go not with you

The late nights
And the street lights
And the people
Look at me girl
And the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
when im with you

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

Anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain

Mente que vai dar uma volta e vem me ver
Entre uma briga e outra de vocês 
Eu nem conheço ela mas me sinto culpada

Primeiro que eu nem devia tá aqui
Segundo cê não tinha que ligar pra mim 
Mas você ligou e eu atendi
Eu penso não, mas falo sim

Que não deixa ela, e nem deixa de me ver 
Bem pior que eu, você

11-YEAR-OLD MUSICAL PRODIGY EMILY BEAR, SET TO RELEASE CONCORD RECORDS/QWEST RECORDS DEBUT DIVERSITY ON MAY 7, PRODUCED BY MENTOR QUINCY JONES

DIVERSITY FEATURES 13-ORIGINAL SONGS WRITTEN BY THE YOUNG PIANIST/COMPOSER IN A ""DIVERSE"" COLLECTION OF STYLES

11-year-old musical prodigy Emily Bear, a pianist and composer set to release Concord Records/Qwest Records debut Diversity on May 7, produced by legendary multi-Grammy Award winning producer, composer and arranger Quincy Jones. Bear, who is managed by Quincy Jones Productions, has the ability to seamlessly move from Classical to Jazz and Be-bop, while demonstrating musical prowess comparable to pianists/composers twice her age, has written 13-original songs for the new project, performed with a Jazz Trio (international release dates may vary). She first broke into the national spotlight at age 6, as a guest on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, performing Mozart, jazz and an original song she composed. She was invited back five more times within the span of two years, performing original music each visit.

Comments Quincy Jones: ""I am at once astounded and inspired by the enormous talent that Emily embodies. She is the complete 360-degree package, and there are no limits to the musical heights that she can reach.""

ME NIEGO

Es difícil abrir mis ojos y ya no verte.
Tu olor en la cama aún sigue intacto.
Te he buscado en mis sueños deseando tenerte
y no encuentro tu rostro por más que trato.

Aún quedan tus retratos en cada rincón de la casa y el silencio me habla de ti. Es que sobra tanto espacio desde que no estás, daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte, porque vuelvas.

Es que me niego a perderte, jamás nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó.
Es que me niego a perderte, jamás nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó, que lo nuestro ya se acabó.

No puedo asimilar que ya tú no estás; sin ti nada es igual.
Sé que por el mundo no hay otra similar,
que tú me hiciste, que no te puedo olvidar.
Tú me quieres a tu manera. Mi mente quisiera, encontrarme quisiera.
Mi corazón dice que por ti espera, que porque volvieras daría lo que fuera.

Pero es que tú, chica, con ese piquete 
dices cómo olvidarte. Y en tus ojos veo que mientes.
Ahora puedo decir: amor, sufrir lo que se siente.
Te sacaré de mi mente y eso será de repente.
 
Pero es que tú, chica, con ese piquete

Y es que me niego a perderte, jamás nunca verte. Me niego aceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó, que lo nuestro ya se acabó.

Me está matando la soledad.
Duele saber que ya no estás.
Quiero pensar que todo esto es mentira
y que al llamarte contestarás, al llegar la noche regresarás.
Aún podemos intentarlo, no te alejes de mi vida.

Yo sigo aquí confundido y solo,
llorando de noche, muriendo de día.
Viviendo esta agonía no puedo entender que ya no seas mía.
El círculo se cierra y el dolor me entierra.
Qué difícil es vivir en esta guerra
Me niego, aunque digas que estoy ciego. Desde que te fuiste soy un andariego.
A todo compromiso tarde le llego.
Distraído, de tu foto no me despego
Si tú eres mi vida, ¿porque me liquidas?
Yo no provoqué tu partida. Necesito tu olor.
Necesito tu calor. Necesito verte encima de mí en ropa interior.

Aún quedan tus retratos en cada rincón de la casa y el silencio me habla de ti. Es que sobra tanto espacio desde que no estás, daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte, porque vuelvas.

ARTISTA: LOS CAFRES
TEMA: SE Q`EL MAR
ÁLBUM: ALAS CANCIONES

“Sé q` el mar” es el primer corte de “Alas Canciones”, nuevo disco de Los Cafres que ya está a la venta en la Argentina, con distribución en Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay y Chile. Con quince nuevas canciones, este es su primer álbum de estudio desde la edición de “El Paso Gigante” en 2011. En el mes de octubre se editará físicamente en México y Centroamérica.
 
Este primer corte lleva impresa la impronta de Los Cafres: la voz cálida e inconfundible de Guillermo Bonetto, sumada a una banda que suena ajustada e impecable y en la que se nota el trabajo y la experiencia que traen en sus más de veinticinco años en el oficio.
 
En palabras de Guillermo Bonetto: “Sé q’ el mar describe un poco el momento de entender que estamos inmersos en una realidad mucho más basta, misteriosa y profundamente interconectada de lo que normalmente percibimos. Que nuestra locura es a veces la mejor guía y que el mero hecho de respirar es ya una batalla ganada, motivo de enorme dicha y agradecimiento.
Y el mar como llave y metáfora del diálogo simple  y profundo del silencio y su música; y como foco y corolario… el Amor, aquel puente a todo lo que vale la pena.”
 
“Sé q´ el mar ” fue grabado en New York y en las playas de República Dominicana durante las últimas giras de la banda por los Estados Unidos y el Caribe en julio y agosto de este año.
El video fue dirigido por Alexander Díaz y Guillermo Bonetto, editado por Pedro Bonetto y filmado por Alexander Díaz.
El tratamiento de color de “Sé q´ el mar” estuvo a cargo de Pedro Bonetto con la colaboración de Octavio Lovisolo.

The rapper GZA of the legendary Wu Tang Clan from Staten Island came to wide attention with ""Enter the Wu Tang Clan (36 Chambers)"".... an album considered one of the greatest hip hop records of all time. It was an exploration of the grime and glory of street life -- and a look at the human condition... messy, triumphant, and honest.

    GZA, aka The Genius, created lyrics that wove through a whole sea of references...including 1930s American literature, jazz, chess, philosophy, crime, and martial arts. The album sealed his place as one of rap music's most intricate and able lyricists...and performers.

    In addition to his work with the Wu Tang Clan, GZA made solo albums.  Liquid Swords  went platinum:  the beats are menacing and hypnotic, the production is atmospheric, and the lyrical content is typically brainy and complex.

    Last year GZA released his 5th solo record, Pro Tools. He's currently touring it all over the world -- though in his performances, he's been paying tribute to the classic Liquid Swords.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And everyday is full of jokers like a deck of cards
So, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece
But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
Cause we out here winning, brought my dogs from out the reservoir. And I'mma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the V-M-A's, told a joke - he never laughed
The rap diablo, free your mind my motto
And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto
So arigato, so shit, you know I'm world famous
And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest
But still to fall in love is like an orgasm
Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it
Thank God that I made it, ask Q where Dave is
He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas
When I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder
And clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
(Hi Sven, isn't this your language?)
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it, shit
It's just a little cocaine sniff
But the lines is longer than parades is
I think it's time to give me all your praises
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit
And if you wanna legal battle, send your ass to David (that's my lawyer) I'm half man-half amazing
Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations
I know the planet Earth is about to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes falling on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this Game of Thrones, it is known I got the 4G
LTE connection bars, no control, fuck Ken Lamar (Fuck you Kendrick!) I don't vote, I never registered
But I'm a magnet for them zeros call me Edward Sharpe
I wake up feeling dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember
Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg
Talking interlocutor, and drinking Arnold Palmer
Any other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan
Laying down the baseline, doing drums with his freehand
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though, man
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit
Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction
With a 6 year old she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like fuck those cops
God damn, it just don't stop
I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yea, I've had the same outfit for 6 days straight
And still all these bitches will get in position
Because I got their pussies all dripping in pain
Somehow, I'm making this music it's just to relate to
And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection, I broke the mirror
It's only for protection, shit keep getting weirder
Now I can't see a thing but, things never been clearer
Call the Mothman its Richard Gere (It's Richard motherfuckin' Gere!)
This is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere
And looking down like we come in peace
I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit
We were just some motherfuckin' kids

AMIGOS NO POR FAVOR

Amigos No Por Favor
Todo comienza muy bien.
Tú me llamas y contesto.
que me extrañas y concuerdo,
que me quieres y te creo;

que si nos vamos a ver
y mis planes los cancelo;
que si quiero acompañarte.
Siempre digo: por supuesto.

Y luego casi todo es felicidad
hasta que me presentas como amiga
y yo me callo mejor
aunque quisiera gritar que no,

que los amigos no
se besan en la boca.
Los amigos no se extrañan todo el día, gente loca.
Los amigos no se llaman a las dos de la mañana.
Los amigos no se deberían dormir en la misma cama.

Los amigos no
se conocen todo el cuerpo.
Por eso anda ve e inventa otra palabra, no te creo.
Amigos no, por favor.
Amigos no, por favor;
porque los amigos no se hacen el amor.

Y entonces digo:
esta fue la última que nos veremos.
No me merezco ser de nadie
su juguete, su pasatiempo.

Pero algo pasa cuando vuelves a llamar
y salimos de nuevo;
todo es tan perfecto
hasta ese momento en que me vuelves a presentar

que los amigos no
se besan en la boca.
Los amigos no se extrañan todo el día, gente loca.
Los amigos no se llaman a las dos de la mañana.
Los amigos no se deberían dormir en la misma cama.

Los amigos no
se conocen todo el cuerpo.
Por eso anda ve e inventa otra palabra, no te creo.
Amigos no, por favor.
Amigos no, por favor;
porque los amigos no se hacen el amor.

[Lyrics]
Sent you a message, sent you a' email
Hasty decisions, we may still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways, the nooks, and thangs with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah that's for sure
Still a bankroller, yeah still couture
But man, this thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a bad place, and no place for a girl
Amongst the scavengers, I found a pretty pearl
It's for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we call em duds
And we, and we and we ahhh

We gotta gettin up
We gotta gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up

Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I again, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end
You respect me like a friend
But love me like your man
No other could contend
Or we could be like Doves exposed to history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go through, they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all night
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up and promise that alright

We gotta gettin up
We gotta gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up

I like to watch everybody gravitate 'twards you
Your magnetic presence make them all come through
The same way you got them, you got me too
Now look at our lives, they so colorful
A wonderful spectrum, not one tone dull
Full of excitement and not one lull
See we had an understanding, oh yes we did
I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin' in my bid
Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs
We like Ruby Dee and Ossie, Martin and Coretta
Doin' it to death, no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our spirits still together
So Come on now, there's a place here for your hand
You rockin' with the number one MC man
The number one controller of right, with the plan

We gotta gettin up
We gotta gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up

The group consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed rock and swamp rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they positioned themselves as Southern rock stylists, singing often about bayous, the Mississippi River, catfish, and other popular elements of Southern iconography.

CCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay[1] and often figures in various media. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone.[2] CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.[3]",31,510,0,0,1941,2011-05-05 12:13:21,0,"creedence, clearwater, revival, suzie, full, length, 60's, 70's, rock, john, fogerty, ccr",CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL : SUZIE Q Full Length,-S1_cEuImL0,300662,CN4CEAA,q,0,11,5,5,125,3,5.4780785420573865,2.2764618041732443,3.2880255353883627,1.4913616938342726,5,18,0.1096153846153846,136,0.35,11,0.35,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.6002151137748177,0.41555844566592864,2.2047136848036435,0,0,3.0

The book is available at ToTheStars.Media now and at a retailer near you.

NEW trade paperback edition is out Feb. 28, 2017 and includes a foreword by a CIA Senior Intelligence Service member; first in the non-fiction series of Sekret Machines, Gods by Peter Levenda, will be out next year.

-------

For those who know… that something is going on…

The witnesses are legion, scattered across the world and dotted through history, people who looked up and saw something impossible lighting up the night sky. What those objects were, where they came from, and who—or what—might be inside them is the subject of fierce debate and equally fierce mockery, so that most who glimpsed them came to wish they hadn’t.

Most, but not everyone.

Among those who know what they’ve seen, and—like the toll of a bell that can’t be unrung—are forever changed by it, are a pilot, an heiress, a journalist, and a prisoner of war. From the waning days of the 20th century’s final great war to the fraught fields of Afghanistan to the otherworldly secrets hidden amid Nevada’s dusty neverlands—the truth that is out there will propel each of them into a labyrinth of otherworldly technology and the competing aims of those who might seek to prevent—or harness—these beings of unfathomable power. Because, as it turns out, we are not the only ones who can invent and build…and destroy.

Featuring actual events and other truths drawn from sources within the military and intelligence community, Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley offer a tale at once terrifying, fantastical, and perhaps all too real. Though it is, of course, a work of… fiction?

Some of his beats could comfortably soundtrack your more hyper nightmares; his hedonism almost always comes with a bit of curdled excess. In person, though — at least on the recent day he dropped by The FADER offices to chop it up with our video team — he can be downright chummy. In the latest edition of our Everything You Need To Know Series, our man Q breaks down everything from his baseball team allegiance to his video-game trash-talking techniques to his childhood love of goofy baggy pants.

Грам не знам какво е срам,
знам кой е Жан Клод Бам Бам
една рецепта лятна знам
мента, glock и валериан
Манго що все оди гладен
като толкоз бой яде?
къде е Маги малки майни?
кажи защо бе докторе?

Пее ми се по големи сцени
а пея по кенефи
едното сигурно е яко,
другото ме кефи.
Рее ми се над големи зЕми
по екзотични релефи
Едни ти викат - На!
а ти им казваш - Дай?
всички викат - 'Земи, 'земи...

Една напред и две назад
around the world на заден ход
Филмът уж да бъде шведски,
а оказа се съветски
Гъз, гъз глава затрива
инерцията ни пребива
заради вселенския кантар
един отпуска, друг се свива

Мани манго той е мангастар
хвани Джаго, той е джагастар
къде ти е Шри Ланка - къде е Занзибар

Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together
From running these streets to being down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm tripping on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
It's all good now (My nigga)
We out the hood now (Mmm)
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears
You were my hoie, my sconey, my Roni
My nigga and never placed no bitch before me
Man, I swear to God I love you forthat shit

Versuri:
Ia ghici ce ne aduce vara!
Un fel de greier cu chitara, ei!
De dimineata pana seara
Sonny, ia vezi ce vrea domnisoara!

Si totu’ merge ceas,
Ca viata mea e mereu in balans
Am multe meciuri ca pe Stade de France
Nu ma refer la XBox
Rulez filme bune mai ceva ca Twenty Century Fox

K! E hot o dau pe gheata ca la hochey
Imi ridica mingea la fileu ca-n volei
Sunt jucator de top ca Barkley 🏀
‘Know what Im sayin’?!

Amator de amor
Sunt si print si cersetor
Ziua dorm, noaptea zbor
Printre inimi calator
De-as iubi, poate as mai sta
Insa stii ca nu e-n Firea mea

Nu ma saruta ca nu ma pot satura/*3
Ca daca te sarut si eu e vai de inima ta!

Nici macar ploaia nu poate stinge vapaia
Ca d-aia noi schimbam foaia atat de des ah
E ceva mistic artistic, e dovedit si statistic
Poti sa rezumi la tipic barbatesc

Ca-i Facebook sau Insta
Ca-i Fifa, Do, Re, Mi, Fa
Punem bifa de verified, ok! yo
Am tipa, am pipa, n-as complica clipa
M-asteapta echipa, ai mei!

Nu ma saruta ca-mi iau iar filme
D-alea de le vad numai cu tine
Nu-ti irosi nervii si timpu’, nu-s tipu’, nu...
Nu vreau mai mult ca-mi iau iar filme

#JottaR
Do joelho remendado para as 30 primaveras
ainda sinto a fragrância dessa pureza tão efémera
do beijo matinal maternal que tanto esperas
mãe gosto muito de ti eram as palavras mais sinceras

as guerras entre irmãos tinham sempre o mesmo fim
"" Quem diz é quem é "" a mãe gosta mais de mim
chinelo em ti chinelo em mim acabava o chinfrim
cada um para o seu lado fazendo caretas mesmo assim

um simples kamehameha fazia os dias risonhos
não tava cá meio cá meio lá vivia o mundo dos sonhos
a inocência e a pureza são valores infantis
por isso uma criança perdoa e é sempre feliz

E este aqui sou eu
de mãos dadas com os meus que eu tanto pedi
Pintava o azul dos céus 
ate perceber que só no desenho consegui ( ver os pais juntos )

mais tarde vem a dor a desilusão de amor
as contas por pagar mau sentido de humor
dali vem um credor dali vem um rumor 
tanta pancada na cabeça que parece um tambor

programaram te para que mintas e desmintas e não sintas
mas ressintas e aos trintas tares nas tintas seres um pintas
que só olhas para o que trincas esquecendo barrigas famintas
e deixando raças extintas Diz me

Há quantos anos não pintas (2x)
Há quantos anos não fintas (2x)
Há quantos anos não brincas yeeeeeeaaah

(#Rafa refrão  2x)
Quando aperta a saudade tu vais sentir
um pouco da tua idade que já te fez sorrir

#JottaR
não existe o preconceito nem diferença racial
não existe religião nem diferença sexual
ate que haja mão adulta o momento é especial 
brinca o filho do doutor com o do bairro social

ser adulto é querer estatuto ver a ganancia a florescer
tar na luta do sucesso alimentar o ego com poder
mulheres e homens a usar se pela busca do prazer
90 por cento a ser explorado para 10 por cento enriquecer

obcecados com o status social e a imagem
os simples prazeres da vida já não os satisfazem
o amor e o respeito hoje quase são uma miragem
vivem a vida do rancor pela falta de coragem

mas eu não vou reprimir a criança que há em mim
para não viver de arrependimentos quando a vida chegar ao fim

Porque esta vida é só uma passagem 
e eu não quero saber como é que os outros agem
eu vivo de amor não vivo de imagem
só quero sentir me livre porque eu nasci selvagem

tu olha para ti tu olha para mim
somos todos iguais porque é que perdeste a matriz
da criança que ri aos molhos encara me olhos nos olhos
a vida és tu que escolhes faz tudo para ser feliz

programaram te para que mintas e desmintas e não sintas
mas ressintas e aos trintas tares nas tintas seres um pintas
que só olhas para o que trincas esquecendo barrigas famintas
e deixando raças extintas Diz me

Há quantos anos não pintas (2x)
Há quantos anos não fintas (2x)
Há quantos anos não brincas yeeeeeeaaah

Lyrics: 

Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key.
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl.
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie.
So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me.
'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin',
6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin'
checkin' out 6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin'

I'm staying in the hotel, not the motel or the holi-day inn.
If that girl don't participate, well then I'ma take her friend.
Well if, mami is with it then, mami can give it then, mami a rider, I'ma, slide up beside her.
I got a suite, you can creep on through, I know you tryin' to get your freak on too,
I'll do it all for that (lady), yeah I ball for that (lady), hit the mall for that (lady),
keep it fly for them (ladies), keep my eye on them (ladies), hot tub for them (ladies),

Connect-R - Incredere | VERSURI

Strofa 1:
Nu-mi cere încredere că n-am nici pentru mine
Cum să dau ceva ce n-am, ceva ce nu-mi poate da nimeni
Mintea-i ipocrită, mă-mbracă în idealuri
Dar mintea minte că mă minte, depresia vine în valuri

Nu știu să înot, că ai mei nu mi-au dat colac
Și mă înec dar nu la mal ci doar când sar din puț în lac,
Doar ca să îti fac pe plac. Uite, ia niște încredere,
Da' când te voi dezamăgi, să știi ca s-au terminat rezervele

Da' tu sa ma crezi, să nu mă intrebi 
Să nu vrei să auzi, să nu vrei să vezi
F*k, fk, f*k! Am uitat ce am mințit
Dar mâine îmi aduc aminte și o sa fii fericită că...

Refren:
Ai încredere în mine, da' te ține doar o zi 
Și iar mă întrebi pe unde am fost și ce-am făcut, 
Dar ce-am făcut? (x2)

Strofa 2:
Mi-am ieșit din minți cu gandul să îti rămân în minte,
Și acum mai sunt în gândul tău da' nu-ți aduci aminte
Spui că n-ai încredere, da’ mintea minte
De-aia minți și tu, însă inima mea simte

Tu să m-aștepti, că eu mă-ntorc
Mă duc să dau demonii afară și jur că mă întorc
Cu sufletul curat, să-ti facă tati loc
Și să scoatem niște fum, că se-ntalnesc apă și foc

Stop joc, da timpului răgaz
Urăște-mă cât vrei, da’ nu uita în nici un caz
Căt a ramas, e de ajuns, ne ține vii
Ține ușa întredeschisă, că nu știi când voi veni
Hai spune...

Refren:
Ai încredere în mine, da' te ține doar o zi 
Și iar mă întrebi pe unde am fost și ce-am făcut, 
Dar ce-am făcut? (x2)

Bridge:
Da' tu sa ma crezi, să nu mă intrebi 
Să nu vrei să auzi, să nu vrei să vezi
F*k, fk, f*k! Am uitat ce am mințit
Dar mâine îmi aduc aminte și o sa fii fericită că...

Refren:
Ai încredere în mine, da' te ține doar o zi 
Și iar mă întrebi pe unde am fost și ce-am făcut, 
Dar ce-am făcut?

Lyrics:

Well, here we are. The four of us...
In total shock... Me and her.
I closed my mouth and swallowed spit,
And I'm thinking to myself, ""This is some deep shit!""
And I said ""So you're gonna tell me he's the one he's been talking to?""
He says, ""Yes"", I say, ""No"", he says, ""Yes"", I say, ""No"", he says, ""It's the truth!""

I said, ""All of you all ass is crazy, let me up out this door,
Because this is way more than I bargained for""
And then she says, ""Wait, I'm sure we can all fix this""
Then I said, ""I'm late, plus I ain't gotta damn thing to do with this!""
But then she said, ""Wouldn't you just like to know how it all began?""
Then I thought to myself, and said, 'Quick, you got three minutes'
Then it got real quiet, I said, ""Somebody start talking""",1835,209,0,1,42701,2011-03-18 00:30:21,1,"When A Woman's Fed Up, Ignition, RKellyVEVO, acoustic, music, Trapped In The Closet Chapter 3 Live, instrumental, vevo, Bump And Grind, Trapped In The Closet 1-12, official, download, Trapped In The Closet Chapter 3 Official Video, karaoke, remix, Step In The Name Of Love, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, R.

Những tin nhắn anh xem vẫn chưa trả lời
Cuộc gọi nhỡ vẫn còn chưa đáp hồi
Có lẽ mỗi người còn bận lo lắng cho riêng mình
Giờ đây chỉ còn một thói quen chưa kịp quên

Đã lâu lắm anh không đón đưa mỗi ngày 
Chẳng còn quan tâm em buồn vui lúc này
Cố đúng hay sai, thì cả 2 chăng thể quay về.

Giờ đây chỉ là
Người xa lạ đã từng quen

Từng khoảng cách, cứ lớn dần
Vậy mà ta chẳng còn tha thiết để bận tâm
Người từng thương sao bỗng xa lạ quá
Vờ không quen, chẳng dám nhìn nhau, vội đi mau.

Một người từng thương nhiều thế
Rồi cũng hoá người dưng
Chẳng còn gọi nhau bằng những
Cái tên mình đã từng
Trả lại nhau những hồi ức
Đôi môi cứ ngập ngừng
Nợ nhau lời xin lỗi.

Một người từng thương nhiều thế
Rồi cũng hoá người dưng.
Chỉ là ngừng yêu mà sao
Lại đau lòng đến thế?
Suốt một quãng đường đời
Tôi chỉ mượn một đoạn đường thôi.

Điều buồn nhất trên đời
Là người thương bỗng hoá người dưng

謝和弦 第三張創作專輯《不需要裝乖》

這世界總有某些堅持己見 否定質疑 評論嘲笑你的聲音
他用他的特立獨行 忠於自我 誠實面對
要擁抱失敗 才能真正感受人生
不怕和世界不同 勇敢渴望愛和用力做夢的滋味
----------------------------------------------------------------------
終於等到！
網路上歌迷最期待拍攝MV的NO.1歌曲！

謝和弦在16歲時寫的歌
也是他第一次上節目在觀眾面前演唱自己創作的歌

「這是最後一次 」
 一種跟自己小時候合作的概念

16歲的謝和弦那時參加了
中視【我猜我猜我猜猜猜】的明日之星選秀，
帶著一把木吉他從南投北上參加節目錄影，
在節目上他毫不羞澀地展現才藝，
也是第一次在電視觀眾面前唱了他的創作歌曲「這是最後一次」。

那時的謝和弦帶著高中生的調皮與純真讓現場的觀眾驚豔，
相隔十二年，謝和弦重新整理歌曲和演唱，
加入大量的弦樂配器，也多了一份經歷青春的『氣口』。

當時他為了喜歡的高中女孩寫了這首歌，
如今重新演唱和編曲，
他也和16歲的自己一起回味著青春，一起成長，
而歌曲尾奏更留給聽眾一個小驚喜，
那是他歷經青春後的另一個禮物。

DEATH IS NOTHING AT ALL (Henry Scott Holland 1847 -1918)

Death is nothing at all,
I have only slipped away into the next room,
I am I and you are you;
Whatever we were to each other, That we still are.

Call me by my old familiar name,
Speak to me in the easy way which you always used,
Put no difference in your tone,
Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.

Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we shared together.
Let my name ever be the household word that it always was.
Let it be spoken without effect, without the trace of a shadow on it.

Life means all that it ever meant,
It is the same as it ever was, there is unbroken continuity.
Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?
I am waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just around the corner.

30 SECONDS TO MARS - R-EVOLVE
Lyrics :
A revolution has begun today for me inside
The ultimate defense is to pretend
Revolve around yourself just like an ordinary man
The only other option is to forget

Does it feel like we've never been alive?
Does it seem like it's only just begun?

To find yourself just look inside the wreckage of your past
To lose it all you have to do is lie
The policy is set and we are never turning back
It's time for execution; time to execute
Time for execution; time to execute!

Does it feel like we've never been alive?
Does it seem like it's only just begun?
Does it feel like we've never been alive inside?
Does it seem it's only just begun?
It's only just begun

The evolution is coming!
A revolution has begun!
(It has begun!)
The evolution is coming!
A revolution has, yeah!

Lauper admitted in an interview with Matthew Rettenmund for his 1996 book Totally Awesome 80s: A Lexicon of the Music, Videos, Movies, TV Shows, Stars, and Trends of that Decadent Decade that she hated the song, which was why she had chosen not to include it on her first compilation.

All versions of the UK edition are considered rare, especially the 12"".

The song has been covered by a few artists, such as Bombones, Haruko Momoi, New Found Glory, and Tomoyuki Uchida. The song was also featured as an instrumental version in Pop'n Music 10.

Steven Spielberg had made Cyndi the musical director for, ""The Goonies"" soundtrack. She sought out new bands to be included on the project including her friends, ""the Bangles.""

Cyndi refused to play the song live after 1986. She finally incorporated it back into her live show during a 2005 concert in Baltimore, Maryland. Fans kept screaming to hear the song, and she sang it acapella. She has since incorporated the song back into her live set, due to overwhelming fan recognition.",852,219,0,0,21449,2010-05-05 12:29:39,0,"cyndi, lauper, the, goonies, 'r', good, enough, mouth, chunk, mickey, data, brand, sloth, movie, music, pop, 80's, pirates, one, eyed, willy, fratelli",Cyndi Lauper - The Goonies 'R' Good Enough,Scu81EW4UC8,5049144,CN4CEAA,r,0,10,5,5,125,2,6.703217756814243,3.3660492098002357,4.331407049219782,2.9304395947667,6,18,0.06534090909090909,206,0.35,21,0.35,7,0,1,0,0,2,3,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,5,1,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,42,0.6461683338299183,0.5021542387427941,1.4780741623048592,0,0,3.0

Snowforms began as a series of sketches of snowdrifts, seen out the window of my Monteagle Valley farmhouse. I took these sketches and traced a pentagram over them. The notes of the piece emerged wherever the lines of the sketch and the stave crossed. Of course I modified the drawings as necessary since the work is primarily a piece of music and only secondarily a set of sketches. I printed the work so that the shapes of the snow were white over a pale blue background"" - R. Murray Schafer

Hardwell, Bizzey, Lil Kleine en Chivv bundelen hun superkrachten. Op 'Ze Willen Mee' combineert Hardwell zijn eigen geluid met de befaamde clubsound van Bizzey die recent leidde tot grote hits als 'Traag' en 'JA!'. Voeg hier de vocalen van Lil Kleine, Chivv, Bizzey en een tank aan toe en je hebt een monstersingle.

Lyrics 

Once you’ve tasted my sweet cherry lips
You’ll be desperate need another hit
Looks can fool you baby I’m a trick
Show you things you never knew you missed
Don’t be greedy with my precious time
I want your body I don’t have the time
You wanna know what I got in mind
Baby come with me
If you wonder what’s behind the walls
I will let you see it all
Are you ready are ready tell me are you ready
I will show you what’s inside my head
Where the girls and boys undress
Are you ready are you ready tell me
Are you ready are you ready now
chorus
Put the girls on the boys
And girls on girls
And the boys on boys
And the girls on boys
Just a little bit more
And a little more

Put the girls on the boys
And girls on girls
And the boys on boys
And the girls on boys
Just a little bit more
And a little more

Verse 2
There’s no limits here the love is free
Let’s get closer to my wildest dreams
There’s no inhibitions can’t you see
Pour your heart out pour it out on me
Don’t be greedy with my precious time
I want your body I don’t have the time
You wanna know what I got in mind
Baby come with me
If you wonder what’s behind the walls
I will let you see it all
Are you ready are ready tell me are you ready

""Eldorado"" to niespodziewane collabo Bedoesa i PlanaBe. Dwie najważniejsze postacie młodej sceny polskiego rapu przygotowały murowany przebój na bicie Deemza.

Producent nowego albumu Solara ma na koncie współpracę z takimi postaciami jak Białas (produkcja albumu ""Rehab""), KęKę, Paluch, Quebonafide czy Sitek. Tym razem przyszła kolej na najmłodsze pokolenie polskiego rapu. Oparty na niezwykle chwytliwej melodii singiel poświęcony relacjom damsko-męskim w świecie rapu, wygląda na hit nie tylko papierze. W połączeniu z teledyskiem, który przygotowała ekipa ToMaSens collabo młodych reprezentantów SB Maffija Label i QueQuality sprawia, że ""Eldorado"" może okazać się jednym z największych hitów 2017 roku.

作曲：謝侃均 
    從高雄前往台北發展的閃亮，厭倦疏離人群與吵雜街道，突然想起雄那熱情奔放的家鄉與幾位摯友們過往青春歲月，便匆匆地收拾行李搭上前往回憶的列車。

    走在故鄉的街道，「閃亮」尋找著好友們。看見「老外」辛勤工作仍被客人抱怨、 「Weeman」被討債集團的人追打、「美麗」因失戀鬱寡歡，即使生活不順遂也是努力的向自己露出以往的笑容。他們四位好友想起初次見面情景、走在曾經一起參加學校熱音社、游泳池消暑籃球三對三鬥牛這些回憶的路上...

    往日的情景一浮現在眼前，他們那稚嫩的時光、飽滿的青春在經過這麼多年社會洗禮之下仍未曾褪色，只是短暫的因為現實生活壓力藏於心底。四位永遠的好朋友在拾起記憶碎片後，來到他們之間祕密基地，伴隨夕陽，他們看著彼此、看著他們都希望永遠不變的情誼。",1,333,0,0,136,2013-03-19 08:30:19,0,,2012南面而歌-X,MN51upY57Zo,15035,CPoBEAA,x,0,13,3,19,78,1,4.177103432436536,1.146128035678238,2.133538908370217,0.0,4,12,0.0,16,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0.5107699492913221,0.2743834463801373,10.0,0,0,3.0

八年級劇作家陳弘洋《再約》，在阮劇團「劇本農場」計畫（2015 年，第三屆）誕生，以新生代的黑色視角，快節奏的高密度敘事，充滿戲謔的俗濫語言，諧仿電視通俗劇的情節，捕捉電視、網路社群媒體氾濫的社會現象中，現代社會的人際關係與相處。

這次阮劇團邀來同樣對當代社會現象有獨到觀察、風格獨具的話題導演李銘宸執導，兩者碰撞之火花，令人期待！

0,jurek46pink,17,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"The term “Maleńka” (A Little One), as a description for a woman or a girl who is the object of somebody’s affection, was very popular in Polish pre-war art or fashion, hence so many Maleńka’s we may find in the written, spoken or, finally, sung form of that time.
The one who was beloved should have been always – a little one.  A little one was supposed to be the most charming. 
And the uploads on this channel - the present one and those which are soon to come - will show as many as three examples of that form in three different songs that were conceived in Poland in mid thirties. 

Herewith – “Maleńka” as a composition of Stanisław (Samuel) Ferszko of 1935, recorded for Syrena-Electro company by Tadeusz Faliszewski and Adam Aston, in bigger fragments of those recordings.  
It seems worth to be noted that both records are of relatively the same condition, still the engineering of the second one is much better and prevails in this preview.

0,LordeVEVO,1847,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"The music on Lorde's 'Melodrama' reflects the wealth of emotions the New Zealand native has experienced of late, and they’re rendered with the kind of poise we’ve come to expect from the pop superstar. Her voice, the melodies, the arrangements she’s chosen to help landscape her feelings - this critically-acclaimed second album is particularly fetching because the 20-year-old singer trusts her idiosyncrasies to fuel her eloquence. “Let’s let things come out of the woodwork,” she coos on “Homemade Dynamite.” That’s what makes the six performances of ‘Vevo X Lorde’ so powerful as well. All her best ideas naturally seep to the surface. Filmed at Electric Lady Sound Studios in New York’s West Village, the mid-August session found Lorde moving through key songs from ‘Melodrama,’ providing each with the proper temperament for the occasion. The set list features “The Louvre,” “Sober,” “Writer In The Dark,” “Supercut,” “Homemade Dynamite,” and “Hard Feelings”/ “Loveless” – she chose to spotlight some of the album’s most vivid moments. Whether backed by a small ensemble, playing the piano alone, or singing a cappella with a squad of vocalists and a beatbox, she brings invention and intensity to the performances. The soft addition of strings and brass adds to the show’s intimacy, and the drama that she’s built a rep on is central to every moment. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, who produced and co-wrote parts of ‘Melodrama,’ arrives on “Writer In The Dark” to support his pal as well.

LYRICS:
Bring you down here in the dead of night
Keep you working
Try to survive
We are secretly watching you too
Trying our best to get at you

RUN

You can Run
But You can’t hide
We’ll always seek
We’ll always find
You can Run
But You can’t hide
We’ll always seek
We’ll always find
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can’t hide
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can’t hide

They’re laughing while finding
I’m hiding, I’m trying
I feel like she’s lying
I feel like I’m dying 
She’s guiding me quietly
Instructing me blindly
Afraid of what might be
I feel like I’m dying

I hear a sound
(it's prolly just a mouse)
I see them in the dark
(I only saw a  spark)
I know there’s someone there
(Not as far as I’m aware)
Why don’t you believe me?
Maybe you’re right
(It’s just another night)
But I heard a creak
(Just go back to sleep)
I’m always quick to rage
(so go back to your stage)
(wait… Now I hear it…)

RUN

What’s that sound 
I know someone’s there
Hiding in the shadows
Thinking I was unaware
Who’s that I see
The birthday boy to be
Let’s invite him over
Hurry up before he’s bolder
Oh Bon-Bon
Let’s make this fun
You can’t deter me this time
No I’m done
I won’t go back to my stage
it’s my new trend
Well let’s say hi to the new friend 

I knew I was right to think I would find you over here
Well isn’t it intriguing that
You seem to be just a little bit weary
Of Bon-Bon and me
Well there’s no need
We know you want to deactivate us
But we just can’t let that happen 
Every night always it never changes
But we can make accidents happen

We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen

It Ain't Me – Selena Gomez Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were sipping whisky neat
Highest floor, the bowery
And I was high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

[Drop: Selena Gomez + Kygo]
It ain't me
It ain't me
It ain't me

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and the liberties
Never growing up
I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It aint me, no no
It aint me, no no
It aint me, no no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It aint me

Written by John as an expression of his love for Yoko Ono, the song is heartfelt and passionate. As John told Rolling Stone magazine in 1970, “When it gets down to it, when you’re drowning, you don’t say, ‘I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,’ you just scream.”

During filming on the roof of Apple, two days after the recording of the track, the band played ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ right after doing two versions of 'Get Back’ and it led straight into 'I’ve Got A Feeling’. Michael Lindsay-Hogg was once again directing a Beatles’ shoot. He and Paul met regularly at the tail end of 1968, while Hogg was directing The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, to discuss the filming of The Beatles’ session in January. By the time that fateful Thursday came around, the penultimate day of January would be the last time The Beatles ever played together in front of any kind of audience.

This is not the version of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ heard on the single but the version from the Let It Be… Naked album – a composite of both versions that were performed on the roof of Apple in Savile Row

Lyrics
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much to late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of fife
But you misread my meaning when i met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me""",9960,347,0,1,189312,2009-10-03 19:54:44,1,"George Michael, George Michael Don't Let the sun go down on me Official, GeorgeMichaelvevo, acoustic, amazing, music, video, vocal, George Michael Official, hq, fast love, jesus to a child, Freedom, and Elton John, Dont Let The Sun Go Down On Me, instrumental, Father Figure, outside, Freedom 90, vevo, Elton John, Listen Without Prejudice, Don't let the sun go down on me live, Vol 1, Faith, George Michael Don't Let the sun go down on me Lyrics","George Michael, Elton John - Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (Live)",RsKqMNDoR4o,50722036,CJYBEAA,t,0,9,10,3,276,5,7.705196677953693,4.157275396454035,5.277178143644761,3.9982593384236984,7,40,-0.037179487179487165,153,0.0904601571268238,25,-0.009595959595959616,13,0,1,0,1,0,7,0,1,3,2,0,0,2,0,6,6,0,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,67,0.6848855862101431,0.5395417625547365,1.3198688971799593,1,0,3.0

You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it 
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I’ll kiss you you’ll say in my ear
Oh we’re in love aren’t we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you’re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don’t break around here 
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells 
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter 
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread 
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know  

That every night I’ll kiss you you’ll say in my ear
Oh we’re in love aren’t we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you’re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don’t break around here 
Oh yeah yeah yeah 

Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home 
And I’m not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go

Every night I’ll kiss you you’ll say in my ear
Oh we’re in love aren’t we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you’re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don’t break around here 
Oh yeah yeah 


Every night I’ll kiss you you’ll say in my ear
Oh we’re in love aren’t we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you’re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don’t break around here 
Yeah yeah yeah 
You know hearts don’t break around here

A standout track from Peter's fifth studio album and the first one  to have a proper title: So was a watershed release in his career. Its marriage of the artistic and the commercial made for an indisputable success, with the album quickly sitting atop the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Aside from some intriguing collaborations – with Laurie Anderson on This Is The Picture, Kate Bush on Don’t Give Up and Youssou N’Dour on In Your Eyes – it was the unity of singer, band and producer that made So such a crucial record in the Gabriel canon.


In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no-one wants you when you lose

Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up you're not beaten yet
Don't give up I know you can make it good

Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born,  on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up you still have us
Don't give up we don't need much of anything
Don't give up  'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
and whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing


Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up you're not the only one
Don't give up no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up you still have us
Don't give up now we're proud of who you are
Don't give up you know it's never been easy
Don't give up 'cause I believe there's a place
There's a place 
Where we belong


Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

LYRICS:

I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love.

Nikki, she’s got no flag to fly, but she don’t seem to mind that much, no she don’t seem 
to mind.
And you, you’ve got your armor on. Nights out in babylon, yeah, nights out in babylon.
But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone.
And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love.
I won’t let you down.

Now Emily’s got no tricks to try, but she don’t seem that much to mind, no she don’t 
seem to mind that much to me. 
And you’ve got what the whole world wants, so strap that armor tighter on, double on 
down like it’s gonna make you free.
But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone.
And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love.
I won’t let you down.

I get asked a LOT about the whole ""should I play a 5 string bass thing?""...

And I get it... because I used to wonder the same thing. 

Should I?...

... Shouldn't I?

So in this bass lesson I'm going to share 5 reasons why you SHOULDN'T play a 5 string bass. 

And they're probably not what you might thing ;) 

As always, see you in the shed...

Raise a white flag

Don’t try to go back

Like I’m impressed 
You aren’t the one you were back then

""STORY BEHIND THE SONG"" - This song was actually written a few years ago on New Years Eve 2008. The day before New Years Eve I met this BEAUTIFUL half English half Vietnamese girl, and we had this amazing day and night together on a cruise ship I was performing on ...I mean, from my end it was PERFECT. Sorta love at first sight, and she seemed equally interested in me. I felt like I'd won the lottery. The next day I woke up and was on cloud 9. Floating on air. That night was New Years Eve and I told her that I would meet her at the bar afterwards where all of her friends were going to be. After my show and ran to the bar right as the countdown for NYE was starting 10, 9, 8, 7 ...and then I saw her ...like in a movie I ran to her right as the clock was striking midnight and I went to give her a hug and she just turned her shoulder and totally blew me off. I stood there kind of stunned. Not the reaction I was expecting at all. I tried talking to her a little, but she didn't seem interested in speaking. I was kind heartbroken. All I could think to do was go to be cabin, find my guitar, and write a song about how I was feeling. It only took me about 10min to write this entire song. I felt much better after, but I'll still never know exactly what happened. Worst New Years Eve ever! haha.

By the time she moved permanently to London in 1970, Canadian Bonnie Dobson had a pretty susbtantial career under her belt: four albums on the Prestige label including the song for which shes best known (Walk me out in the) Morning Dew plus two on RCA Victor.

Born in Toronto in 1940, she got into folk seriously as a teenager on summer camps where people like Pete Seeger and Leon Bibb would turn up to give concerts. She got her break in 1960, left university and started touring in the States.

I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.

Grief over theft
What followed were those six albums, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and settled in the city the following year.


Lost Ladies of Folk
She recorded just this one album for Argo, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew), followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues, retrospectives and compilations.

She had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world, she stayed, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College, London.

In 2007, 28 years after she made her UK debut there, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship. By all accounts she was on fine form.",0,237,0,0,30,2010-03-01 17:46:45,0,"bonnie, dobson, rare, folk, rock, acoustic",Bonnie Dobson - You don't know,xz3QymqFlyQ,3017,CN4CEAA,t,0,10,3,1,60,0,3.4795753101749884,0.0,1.4771212547196624,0.0,3,9,0.08998682476943345,373,0.3,5,0.0,5,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,5,6,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,30,0.4245119369597371,0.0,10.0,0,0,3.0

Lyrics:
một mình anh ngồi đây , phố quen em qua nơi này
nhìn dòng người vội vã , nắng cũng đã tắt nơi bên hiên nhà

nơi đó sẽ có  một ai mang yêu thương em quay trở lại  
bờ môi ấy còn đâu  ngày mình bên nhau

 phố sao xa lạ quá , chẳng như ngày đôi ta
mắt môi ai cười nói yêu và yêu chỉ thế thôi 
 
cớ sao mưa vội vã , mang bước chân người đi xa 
về đến nơi đâu , để ta tìm thấy nhau

Baby when you go
Why you dont let me know ?
Để bây giờ anh bối rối với những tiếc nuối chẳng thể nói

Oh baby when you go
Why you dont let me know ?
Vì em chẳng còn bận tâm anh có ra sao hay đang thế nào  

giờ thì nơi đâu đâu cho ta thôi nhớ nhau 

 

when you go ... let me know 


if you go hmmm
if you go hmmm
if you go ... let me know

Khi cơn đau đang giày xéo tim anh thì lúc đó em đang bên một ai
Khi tuổi trẻ ta còn quá ngây ngô phải không ? Để có thể tính đến chuyện một mai
Khi ta nghĩ rằng ta có tất cả thì lúc đó đôi ta đã đánh mất lẫn nhau
Khi em nghĩ mọi chuyện sẽ qua thôi , tìm ngã rẽ xa xôi thì ngay lúc đó tim anh vẫn đau
Có lẽ vòng tay anh không đủ rộng để có thể che chở cho em đi đến hết suốt cuộc đời
Bến bờ hạnh phúc có thể là nơi mà anh sẽ không được tới
Em ôm những giấc mơ mình ra đi , bàn tay anh không kịp với
Để lại tim anh là những đau thương .. hằng đêm anh ôm cơn đau rã rời
Và từng ngày vẫn thế thôi , dòng thời gian vẫn thế trôi 
Chỉ còn lại đây mỗi tôi , nhớ điều ngỡ như quen thuộc
Anh đã yêu em nhiều lời nói và chưa từng muốn dừng lại
Có lẽ em chính là nỗi đau ngọt ngào nhất mà con tim anh từng trải
Em ở đâu .. qua bao tháng ngày dài .. ?
Yêu cho ta biết .. thế nào là mệt nhoài
Anh vẫn ở đây , nơi phố quen ta từng qua
Mùi hương quen thuộc .. ngỡ như em chưa từng xa
Giá như chưa từng nhớ chưa từng thương
Để cho con tim không còn vấn không còn vương
Ngày em ra đi , sao lại chẳng nói một lời
Để những hoài nghi đi theo anh suốt một đời

Hi B Boys and B Girls!  Thanks for watching MattyB's version of Cher Lloyd's hit song, ""Want U Back!""  His older brothers recently got phones (which is NOT fair) and so he's decided it's time for him to get one too.  His mom was letting him play with her iPhone AKA his phone but she said it's distracting him too much and he's not old enough to need a phone.  ????  He thinks it's completely ridiculous.  He has no idea what he's going to do for the next few days.  Be sure to post a comment below telling his parents why you think he NEEDS an iPhone.  Maybe you guys can help change their minds!  :) 

If you like his video you can help spread his music by clicking LIKE, FAVORITE & SHARE  with your friends on Facebook & Twitter!  If enough people send it to Cher Lloyd and she sees it... well... that would be #SuperSwag

Oh and if you want one of those gnarly MattyBRaps bracelets you can find them here:
http://mattyb.spreadshirt.com  I had them make some pink ones too for the B Girls!  :)


Keep following your dreams!

Lyrics:

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past - you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u gotit bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else

Lyrics:

I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree
In L.A. or Melrose, boy if you didn't know it, well, now you know,
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things they don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I have been holding us down on my own

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking, asking me why
Why I never left you, and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if ya rich or poor
Out or in doing 5 to10

LYRICS: 
Last night put the heavy on me 
Woke up, and I’m feeling lonely 
This world gotta a way of showin’ me 
Some days it’ll lift you up 
Some days it’ll call your bluff 
Man, most of my days I ain’t got enough 

And all I know is You’re my only hope 

When I’m up, when I’m down 
When the wolves come around 
When my feet hit the ground 
I just need, I just need U 
On my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
No, it ain’t gonna change 
I just need, I just need U 
Lord, I need U 
Yeah, I just need U 

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil for thou art with me 
Thy rod and thy staff … 
They comfort me when I’m beat down broken 
Hold my heart when it’s split wide-open 
Turn these eyes to my sole protector 
And break the will of this born defector 

When You pull me closer I come to life 

Ain’t no way this thing gon’ change, it’s U 
I need on my darkest days, when I’m losing faith 
I need U every single day, every breath I take 
I need U

Lyrics:
[Intro: Alison Wonderland]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Alison Wonderland]
No one knows you better than yourself
Tryna tell me all these faking sells
I see what it really is
Honest words will never fizz
Give it to me, I can hold my own
I know what it's like to be alone
No need to keep me in the dark
Already been, I got that spark

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Coyne]
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around

[Chorus: Alison Wonderland & Wayne Coyne]
Didn't need them anyway, I got it
Go make your own delay, you're not it
Look at me standing straight, I'm on it (baby, I don't know)
Go free your mind that way, I get it
Didn't need them anyway, I got it (baby, I don't know)

[Post-Chorus: Alison Wonderland]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Alison Wonderland]
Friends who never come will never go
Swimming through the deep end, let it show
Red flag, don't wait
I know your fate
All the highs but it's never enough
Where were you when I was doing tough?
Lift me above, all that I love
Water my soul, know that I'll grow

[Pre-Chorus 2: Wayne Coyne & Alison Wonderland]
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you (you don't know)
Someone else to throw your heart around (you don't know)

[Chorus: Alison Wonderland & Wayne Coyne ]
Didn't need them anyway, I got it (you don't)
Don't make your own delay, you're not it (know how)
Look at me standing straight, I'm on it (you, baby, I don't know)
Go free your mind that way, I get it (know)
Didn't need them anyway, I got it (baby, I don't know)

[Bridge: Alison Wonderland & Wayne Coyne ]
You don't know how it is (baby, I don't know)
You don't know
You don't know (baby, I don't know)

[Chorus: Wayne Coyne & Alison Wonderland, Both]
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you (you don't know)
Someone else to throw your heart around
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you (you don't know)
Someone else to throw your heart around (you don't know)

Hey girl you like me a little bit

Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit

She wanna see me put in work for it 
Dig it, digity digging in the dirt for it 
For what? A golden ticket and the chance
At one day maybe holding her hand
Shorty where you wanna go with it
Said I’m just tryna roll with ya
I’m just tryna grow with ya
Girl quit it 
Lord have mercy when I see ya in my throw back jersey 
I’ll admit it I’m smitten
Baby girl salute cause you got me at attention
Shorty you the truth
Oh and ooh and did I mention
One and two
Me plus you
We go way back like alphabet soup
And I gotta give credit where the credit is do
Shout out to ya momma and ya grandma too
Tell me what's the situation
Why the hesitation
Um, have you talked to my daddy?
That’s another conversation

Hey girl you like me a little bit

You want a girl this real (all day)
You think you might catch feels (you may)
I know you like that yes
But will you treat a girl with respect
You say you want me to roll with ya
Say you want me to grow with ya
Then I need to see the full 4k picture
I ain’t dumb - you can spit your game
But does your heart mean the words that you’re saying?
Boy what you gonna do if i choose
To take another chance and learn another dance with you
How do 
How do you protect me, promise to respect both me and you 
Cause I ain’t playing games boy
If I let you catch me tag you’re it
I think i’m falling just a little bit

Hey girl you like me a little bit
No, I don’t even like you a little bit
Come on girl - you like me a little bit
Ha! Not even a little bit!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohhhhh just a little bit

Want me to pull out your chair
A little bit more
Open the door
A little bit more
What if I buy you flowers an take you to dinner?
Yeah?
Balcony on the top floor
Keep talkin
What if I take you to a movie
Boy do you really think that’d move me
What if I buy you a ring and make sure it fits
What!?  Boy that ain’t a little bit!

Ay baby weh you ah deal with?
We come through a lot of things you know?
Wo wahamum to you?
Me make one little mistake you wan dun us?

If I had you back in my world
I would prove that I could be a better girl
Oh, oh, oh
If you let me back in
I would sho'nuff never never let you go again (hey baby)
I was so foolish to ever leave your side,
Searching for what was right before my eyes
It was me who didn't realize
'til it was gone but now I know I need you in my life

Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat (bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath (baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain (bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm about to go insane (baby I need you bad)

Lyrics:

Last night I slept alone 
I stayed at home 
For the first time since you've been gone babe 
No friends to understand 
To lend a helping hand 
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known 

How you walked away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me? 
Yes you promised me that you'd never leave boy 
But you went away babe 
And it's such a shame 
How could you turn your back on me? 

If you really don't want me 
If you really don't need me 
If you really don't love me 
Tell me who do you love? 
If you really don't want me 
If you really don't need me 
If you really don't love me

TEKST:

Ja vjerovala sam u tvoju priču da si pravi, 
Da jedina sam ja u tvome srcu, tvojoj glavi,
A ti bio si dno, varao me sa sto. 
Sada gledaj me i pati, 
S drugim sve ću ti vratiti!

REF.

Dobrodošao u klub, sjedi, udobno se smjesti,
Prevarenih ima svud, zar to nisu dobre vijesti? 
Mene ti, a tebe ja, ama svima to se desi, 
Dobrodošao u klub: oko za oko, zub za zub!

Znaš, takvi kao ti ni pred Bogom se ne stide 
A ovaj život moj nek na tvoju dušu ide 
Jer ti bio si dno, varao me sa sto 
Sada gledaj me i pati 
S drugim sve ću ti vratiti!

REF. x2

A skoro smo se smijali i pričali o genima, 
Maštali o djeci i o njihovim imenima.
Mislili da skupa ćemo zlo i dobro dijeliti, 
Za bolji život štedjeti, u bolji kraj preseliti, 
ali tebi, očigledno, sve to bilo malo je, 
zbog tvoje glupe slabosti sve u vodu palo je!
Jedna ružna riječ dobro te opisuje, 
Ali boljet će te kao mene, to ti potpisujem!

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm, 
I've been kicked around since I was born

And now it's all right, it's OK
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand 
The New York times effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And were stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man and I just can't lose
You know it's all right, it's ok
I'll live to see another day

LYRICS
Say something I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning love
Just starting to crawl

Say something I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you

Say something I'm giving up on you
Say something I'm giving up on you
Say something

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know, sometimes words have two meanings
In the tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forest will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the may queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you, at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

Lyrics:

On a cob web afternoon,
In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages of a book full of death;
Reading how we'll die alone.
And if we're good we'll lay to rest,
Anywhere we want to go.

In your house I long to be;
Room by room patiently,
I'll wait for you there like a stone.
I'll wait for you there alone.

And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels,
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven;
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago.
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on.",64721,300,0,1,1571878,2009-10-25 07:20:03,1,"Audio Slave, Audioslavevevo, vevo, official, video, music video, Like a Stone, single, album, hq, Audioslave, Epic/Interscope, Like A Stone, Pop",Audioslave - Like a Stone (Official Video),7QU1nvuxaMA,414529318,CGQQAA,v,0,9,10,25,298,6,8.617555251883507,4.830370504409103,6.196418835607402,4.811045218912109,8,43,0.3595959595959596,157,-0.07142857142857142,13,0.0,6,0,3,0,1,2,4,2,0,0,5,0,1,2,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,42,0.7190460234360637,0.560526780881776,1.2879568895443807,1,0,3.0

I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it.

Somebody That I Used To Know lyrics

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know

Somebody...

Hip-hop has arguably been the best genre of music in the past two decades. As hip-hop maintains its title, a lot has changed about the genre, such as the lyrics. Hip-hop has two phases, old school and new school each of which give off a different vibe. These phases can be divided into Mumble Rap and Lyrical Rap.
#hiphopuniverse #hiphopcomparisons 

Old School “Hip-Hop” has music based prevalently on African American culture. Artists such as Tupac, Biggie Smalls, and Eazy-E often rap about the struggles of growing up in a racialized environment and the work they put in to get where they are today.

In popular songs such as “Changes” by Tupac and “Juicy” by Biggie Smalls, the artists explain how they went from “negative to positive” as Biggie put it.

Old school hip-hop is still popular today and is regarded as “classic” by many hip-hop fans.

“New school” hip-hop has different types of lyrics. Rappers from today’s generation sing typically about girls, money, and cars they have. Some even sing about how they do drgs, drink alchl, and party which sets a bad example for some listeners. Some of these rappers today did not have it as hard as rappers back in the old days. Also Hip-hop artists now are racially diverse, so African American culture is not necessarily found in music today.

People who grew up listening to Tupac, Biggie, Eazy-E, and so on typically do not enjoy hip-hop in today’s era. Songs written when rap was introduced were lyrically better because rappers were able to tell a story using words that rhyme and flow.

Some songs are also more appealing to fans because they can relate to the struggles their favorite rappers faced.

People of this generation are used to listening to new school hip-hop which is the most played genre on the radio. These same fans reject old school Hip-Hop as a part of the music genre. There are even rappers who know nothing about the most influential Hip-Hop artists.

Growing up listening to Eminem has caused me to fall in love with him as an artist. He introduced me to Hip-Hop. But I noticed a change in the music industry. Artists wanted to be part of the mainstream industry and they had to change their music to fit into the mainstream category.

Because of new artists in hip-hop, many lessen known artists are rarely noticed. These artists are said to be “underground.” Underground rappers usually do not make it big because they have music related to the messages embodied by old school hip-hop artists would say.

I’m a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I’m cooking, boy

Let me take you

And it’s okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I’m on the menu

For the world’s best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

No waterfall, she drippin’ wet, you like my ice? (blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, “What’s the price?” (hold on)
If she do right told her get whatever you like

(Offset)
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine, and my diamonds change the climate

(Quavo)
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
She got her hot light on screaming, “I’m ready”
No horses, no carriage

Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there’s
Still a chance for you
‘Cause there’s a spark in you

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

You don’t have to feel
Like a waste of space
You’re original
Cannot be replaced
If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow
Maybe the reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect …
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it’s time you know

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It’s always been inside of you, you, you
And now it’s time to let it through

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Będzie to drugi solowy album rapera w 2016r.
Pierwszy krążek ""10/29"" trafił do sklepów 4 marca i utrzymał sie 27 tygodni na liście OLiS pokrywając się platyną.

Nowy materiał nawiązuje swoim tytułem do zespołu AIFAM w którym Paluch działał w latach 2005-2010.
OKO był to obraźliwy zwrot kierowany do wszystkich oponentów i wrogów, pochodzący z wewnętrznego slangu ekipy.
Przez lata działalności w Poznańskim podziemiu zespół nagrał kilka utworów pod tytułem OKO czy OKO STYL.

Po kilku latach od rozpadu grupy Paluch nawiązuje do tego okresu zmieniając delikatnie znaczenie zwrotu OKO
i rozwijając je do ""Ostatni Krzyk Osiedla"".

Ostatni Krzyk Osiedla jako ostatnie pokolenie pamiętające prawdziwy klimat osiedli na których zawiązywały się przyjaźnie na całe życie, liczyła się szczerość, prawdziwość i relacje face to face a nie tylko internetowe znajomości.
Nie oznacza to jednak że materiał w swojej formie będzie klasyczny czy przesiąknięty brzmieniem z lat 90'.
To do czego przyzwyczaił nas raper na poprzednich produkcjach to przede wszystkim świeżość brzmienia i to pozostaje bez zmian.
Lirycznie album będzie bardziej szorstki od swojego poprzednika z początku 2016 roku.
Tematyka utworów porusza problemy społeczne oraz opisuje to jak wygląda miejska dżungla w XXI wieku.
Nie zabraknie też wielu odniesień do dzisiejszej sceny hip-hopowej.

Żabson powraca z premierą klipu do onirycznego utworu “Incepcja”, czyli najnowszym singlem z nadchodzącego wielkimi krokami debiutanckiego albumu. Premiera stanowi nie tylko zapowiedź nowości, ale także nowej wizji, która będzie towarzyszyła wydawnictwu. Zadebiutuje na początku roku pierwszym długogrającym LP, a na wiosnę należy spodziewać się trasy koncertowej promującej nowy materiał.

TEKST PIOSENKI:
Niemiec płakał, jak sprzedawał!

Idzie przez miasto wymalowania niunia
i myśli, że jest seksi i błyszczy, jak gwiazdunia,
lecz nie wie, że to ja od dziś tu rządzę całym światem,
bo wbijam na miasto passatem

Ref.
Każdy dobry chłopak z polskiej wsi,
wozi się passatem w TDI,
każda fajna niunia dobrze wie,
że w passacie dobrze bawi się

Wbijamy na imprezę, silnik robi kle kle,
kobity czują piniądz, mówią o mnie w mieście,
kupiłem go, bo Miras przywiózł go z Niemiec
i każda niunia chce w nim siedzieć

Ref.
Każdy dobry chłopak z polskiej wsi,
wozi się passatem w TDI,
każda fajna niunia dobrze wie,
że w passacie dobrze bawi się

Bo kiedyś poloneza tańczyło pół świata,
więc dziś zatańczymy passata

Cóż warta noc kiedy już nie ma gwiazd 
Cóż watr jest dzień kiedy zbladł słońca blask 
I tylko wiatr błądzi znów pośród drzew 
Przyjdź do mnie, przyjdź 
Czekam wciąż, wołam Cię 

Przyjdź w taką noc kiedy lśnią setki gwiazd 
Przyjdź w taki dzień kiedy znów wstaje brzask 
Bo przecież wiesz, że kocham Cię tak jak nikt 
A więc proszę Cię, a więc proszę Cię
A więc proszę przyjdź w taką noc

6 listopada światło dzienne ujrzy najnowszy singiel zespołu ENEJ pod tajemniczym tytułem “Zagubiony”. Wydawać by się mogło, że po wielu latach udanej przygody z muzyką młodzi (ciągle) muzycy niczym nie zaskoczą. Nic bardziej mylnego! Próżno szukać wszystkiego do czego ENEJ tak nas przyzwyczaił, miejsce energetycznego, skocznego rytmu zajmuje bowiem balladowa płynność, a zachęcające do zabawy strofy tym razem zadają pytania dotyczące życia, które wszyscy wiedziemy. Nie brak oczywiście szerokiego instrumentarium, możemy spodziewać się także pięknej melodii, a wszystko to połączone w niezwykle klimatyczną opowieść o poszukiwaniu samego siebie, pełną pytań, które często sobie zadajemy. Czy warto sięgnąć po najnowszą propozycję zespołu ENEJ? Każdy, kto ceni połączenie pięknych melodii z autentycznym przekazem z pewnością doceni pracę olsztyńskich muzyków i odpowie twierdząco.

truTV announces the first ever tour of ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING LIVE! which kicks off on September 13 in Seattle at the legendary Showbox. Starring comedian Adam Conover and featuring his trademark humor and wit, the 15-city live stage show will feature elements of the recently-announced Adam Ruins Everything Election Special, which will be shot immediately following the tour and premiere Tuesday, October 23 at 10pm ET/PT on truTV. 

""I'm so excited to give audiences across the country a sneak peek of the Adam Ruins Everything Election Special before it hits truTV,” said Conover. “We'll be breaking down the history of our nation's election system, dispelling myths about our democracy, and diagnosing what makes this election different from any other. And every show will feature never-before-seen material that won't make it to TV and guarantees to blow your mind.""

The Adam Ruins Everything television series stars Conover as he embarks on a comically inventive yet unrelentingly serious quest to reveal the hidden truths behind everything you know and love. Tackling topics ranging from football and weddings to drugs and prison, he gives you not just fun facts to know and tell your friends, but information that will make you see the world in a whole new way. 

In the upcoming hour-long election special and on the corresponding ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING LIVE! tour, Conover brings that same approach to the upcoming presidential election and explains everything you need to know before entering the booth on Election Day.

Lyrics:

The books you think I wrote are way too thick.
Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn't be a dick?
And I don't watch you when you sleep.
Surprisingly I don't use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep

You're not going to heaven
Why the fuck would you think I'd ever kick it with you?
None of you are going to heaven
There's a trillion aliens cooler than you

You shouldn't abstain from rape just 'cause you think that I want you to
You shouldn't rape 'cause rape is a fucked up thing to do
(Pretty obvious, just don't fucking rape people, please, didn't think I had to write that one down for you)

I don't think masturbation is obscene
It's absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen
You make my job a living hell and I sent gays to fix overpopulation
And boy did that go well

You're not going to heaven
Eat a thousand crackers sing a million hymns
None of you are going to heaven
You're not my children
You're a bad game of Sims

You shouldn't abstain from pork just 'cause you think that I want you to
You can eat pork 'cause why the fuck would I give a shit?
(I created the universe, think I'd draw the line at the fucking deli aisle?)

You argue and you bicker and you fight
Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night
Over what they think is true
But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you

You pray so badly for heaven
Knowing any day might be the day that you die
But maybe life on earth could be heaven
Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth a try

[2x]
My love's the type of thing that you have to earn

[Zorak]
Nie ma już MacGyver'a jak i bomby z zapałek,
""Bajer w Bel-Air"" zrzucił z serca swój kamień,
Chuck Norris już nie gra, obstawia sobowtórów,
Nawet z Drużyną A głową nie przebijesz muru,
Kaczor Donald. Jaki Kaczor Donald? McDonald,
Z bliźniaków jeden został, więc uważaj na słowa,
Zimny Lech. Wolę browar, krwawa Marry to z lodem,
Wstrząśnięte, nie mieszane, zawsze dwa cztery na dobę
Nie ma gum Turbo w kioskach, oranżady w proszku,
Zniknęła Polo Cockta na rzecz producenta koksu,
Nate Dogg nie żyje, Snoop Dogg nie żyje, 
No żyje ale zginie tu przez techno za chwile.
Włochy bankrutują, Grecja to bankrut,
Rozum, rozsądek? Wymieniaj czego brak tu.
Chcesz? Pokażę Ci świat mój, wybacz że zazdroszczę
Normalności nie hajsu, dla wychowanych w Polsce.

[O.S.T.R]
Nie ma Atari ST, nie ma Amigi 500
Sega jak wypuszcza coś, to z klasyki, nic więcej
16 bit grafika, dla tych co nie chcą zapomnieć
bogactwo PRL'u, przez korzenie, ich progres.
Skończyło się jak Bruce Lee, czy misja w kosmodromach
Nie nagra tego Grundig czy Unitra Diora.
Commando zamiast zbawić świat, zrujnował Kalifornie
Rambo uciekł przed śmiercią, ale nie przed botoxem.
Pamiętasz z Panem Kleksem, przygody w kosmosie?
Spójrz, jebany dzisiaj wciska kredyty na procent.
Na chuj mi twój hajs, może zamienić się w pieniądz.
Dla robaków obojętne jest to 3 metry pod ziemią
Brak w NBA Barkley'a, robi dla TNT
Jordan zamienił parkiet na żetony do gry
Rodman, nie jest tym samym, co pompował Madonnę
Mel Gibson nie wyjebał żony już ze dwa miesiące.
Gdzie Ciechowski czy Riedel, Niemen, Nalepa czy Jantar
Serce boli gdy słyszę erę ściemniaczy bez jaj.
Stan na zero, jeden, dwa, fakt to w nas chwile wspomnień.
Wychowani w Polsce wierzą w życie i progres.

Ref.
Kiedy przyszłość to walka. Czy wiesz gdzie prawda leży?
Kiedy przeszłość jest warta, tyle co z niej zabierzesz. 
Nie chcę kraść, nie chce bić, nie chcę zabijać by żyć.
To nasz kraj, ludzie w nim, tacy sami jak my.

To znowu my, stara matura
Kolorowe sny, kontra martwa natura
Nomenklatura pożegnała z wielkiej płyty bloki
Gdy Kyle Minogue zaśpiewała ""I should be so lucky""
Felicita, Romina Power i Al Bano, 
czy recital ""Piccolo Coro dell'Antoniano""
Jose Feliciano zagrał piano swoje struny
Nie brakuje komuny, brakuje Turbo gumy
brakuje Pol Sportów, nie brakuje Paszportów
Brakuje Sofiksów, nie brakuje remixow
Prefiksu, latexu i jeansów, Jim Beam'sów
Simpsonów i Simsów, Durexow, legginsów
Brakuje pomysłów, na siebie cudzysłów
W czasach zysków bez namysłu, w czasach zmysłu kryzysu,
Nie jeden ziom prysł już, za kanał La Manche
Nie jeden tu został, kosząc jego hajs.

[Kochan]
Nie ma sofiksów, korko-trampek Stomila
Dzisiaj cały świat wyprodukowano w Chinach
Ruszyła maszyna, której nie można zatrzymać,
Jak efekt cieplarniany czy śmierć po narodzinach
Nie ma King Dzong Illa, Kadaffi gryzie piach
Bin Laden zabity, Saddam tez nie miał szans.
Eazy-E nie żyje, jak i Tupac nie żyje
skończyła się Dynastia, Bonanza niczym He-Man
Nie ma kapiszonów, saturatora z sokiem, 
kartek na benzynę, choć i tak płacimy krocie.
""5,10,15"" nie ma jest trzydzieści-dwa, 
będzie trzy, jeśli wcześniej nie zasnę
Człowiek z blizną, nie ma już takich
inaczej wygląda ten świat niż przed laty
To dla mnie dużo znaczy, 
nie mogę zapomnieć tego co było, 
Wychowany w Polsce.

Na scenie w międzyczasie pojawił się motocykl Piotra „Dzikiego” Chancewicza, gitarzysty zespołu Wild Pig. Grafika tego jednośladu wyszła spod rąk Szymona Chwalisza, specjalisty od technik aerografu. Nawiązuje ona do powstańczego zrywu stolicy.
Temat Powstania Warszawskiego na Woodstocku przewijał się w ciągu całego dnia. Wspominała o nim Agnieszka Holland, której matka była czynnym Powstańcem. Na festiwalu obecny jest także namiot „Miasto 44” w którym codziennie odbywają się warsztaty. Na dodatek w sobotę odbędzie się spotkanie z producentami filmu Dużym Namiocie ASP.

Pamięć o polskiej historii jest wciąż bardzo żywa na Najpiękniejszym Festiwalu Świata. Dbajmy wspólnie o jej gorliwe pielęgnowanie.

D-Note is on the beat 
The Beatlllionare 
Bebé 
Yeah! 

[Estribillo: Alex Rose] 
Ya te conozco, lo veo en tu cara 
No te comportes, conmigo puedes ser mala 
Seré tuyo por esta noche 
Te soltarás antes que desabroche el cinturón 
Dime que posiciones tú quieres 
Sé que tiene' novio, pero a mí es que me prefiere 
Seré tuyo por esta noche 

[Coro: Lenny Tavárez] 
Prepárate, bebé, porque hoy yo quiero comerte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Como tú, ninguna, tú le ganas a todas 
Por eso bebé yo quiero comerte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Él te tiene seca, yo te mojo toda 
Yo te mojo toda, bebé

[Verso 1: Alex Rose] 
To' el mundo te quiere porque como tú ninguna 
Y yo por ti saco hasta poderes y te bajo la luna 
Hay muchas mujeres, la vida es sólo una 
Y sólo dime que si pa' ponértelo de una 
Bebesita solo avisa 
Pa' subir los cristales, prender y quitarme la camisa 
Quiero que seas mi sumisa 
Si quieres tómate tu tiempo, tranquila no tengo prisa 
Que la noche es joven y el jevo tuyo no se da cuenta 
Ese cabrón es feka no tiene lo que aparenta, yeh 
Tú eres mucho pa' él, eso es lo que comentan 

[Verso 2: Lenny Tavárez] 
(Lenny Tavárez, baby) 
No sé si nos queremos (nos queremos) 
Tú estás con él, pero hace tiempo que nos vemos 
Siempre que estamo' a solas, bellaquemaos y nos comemos 
Conmigo, tus venías se van al extremo 
Y ese cabrón con esa película 
Ya tú no sales con él, te sientes ridícula 
Prefieres quedarte solita en la casa pa' así llamarme 
Y yo, puesto pa' buscarte cuando me necesitas 
Envíame un Snapchat de eso' 
Un selfie tirándome beso' 
Voy de camino a bajarte el queso 
Cuando cruzé la linea, no me equivoqué 
Si te descubren, di que yo te provoqué

[Coro: Alex Rose] 
Porque hoy yo quiero comerte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Como tú, ninguna, tú le ganas a todas 
Por eso, bebé, yo quiero comerte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Me dices, bebesita, y nos vamos a todas 
Pa' comerte toda, yeh 

[Verso 3: Lyanno] 
Ly-Ly-Ly 
Contigo tengo fantasías desde la high 
Esposas y correas, sabes lo que hay 
Hasta una con el Kush pa' ponerte high 
Y en la cama a tu novio ya decirle ""Bye"" 
Bruto, bruto con cojone' 
Siempre usando el condón y pa' colmo te pone todas mis cancione' 
Pa' dejarlo te dice sesentinueve y mil razones 
Tu toto late por mí, mas que hace corazones 
Y lo hacemo' lento 
Cuando nos besamo', se detiene el tiempo 
Sin palabras, disfrutamos el momento 
Y repetimos el cuento 

[Coro: Lyanno] 
Baby, porque quiero maltratarte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Como tú, ninguna, tú le ganas a todas 

[Verso 4: Rauw Alejandro] 
(Yeah, Ra-Rauw) 
Te hicieron para mí 
Lo supe aquella noche que te tuve 
Apreciando toda tu desnudez 
Cuando mi lengua corría toda tu piel 
Me hicieron para ti 
Lo supiste cuando gritabas mi nombre 
Baby, yo soy el que te corresponde 
Que rico fumar antes de comernos 
El destino nos cambio to' los planes 
Tú dime cuando pa' volver a vernos 
Tienes algo más cabrón, ya olvídate de él 

[Puente: Rauw Alejandro] 
Además del sexo, mami, quiero amarte toda 
Conmigo vas al cielo, tú te vienes toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Me dices, bebesita, que nos vamos a todas 
Contigo voy a todas, yeh 

[Verso 5: Cazzu] 
Como quieras, papi, rápido o lento 
Soy adicta a tu movimiento 
Y aunque hay veces que yo te miento 
En las noches se me nota lo que siento por ti 
Hay gente diciendo no, que somo' anormale' 
Siempre nos comemo' como si fuesemo' animale' 
Es lógico que me reclame' 
Y sabes que si estoy con él, me llamas y desarmo los plane' 
Sabe bien que como yo no hay dos 
Prendiendo uno haciéndolo 
Olvidándono' del reloj 
Y que cuando ella te habla, tú te imaginas mi voz 
Yo ya lo descubrí, que tú eres para mí, que yo soy para ti 
Baby, quédate aquí, más cerquita de mí, él no me lo hace así 

[Coro] 
Tú quieres comerme toda 
Él me lo hace a medias, tú me besas toda 
Quédate conmigo y pichéale a todas 
Como yo, ninguna, yo le gano a todas 
Ven cómeme toda 
Hoy yo quiero comerte toda 
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda 
Quédate conmigo y le picheo a todas 
Me dices, bebesita, y nos vamos a todas 
Pa' comerte toda, yeh

Es sólo una historia más..
La Bella y la Bestia

[Porta]

Ella era bella,
frágil como una rosa,
él era una bestia
esclavo de sus impulsos

Único día que les ataron esposas
ya no eran niños,
crecieron,se hicieron adultos juntos

Todo marchaba bien,
eso parecía en su primera luna de miel
juró serle de por vida fiel
y ella a él,
una historia como otra cualquiera(sí)
quién les ve y quién les viera

Pero el tiempo pasa
y las relaciones se agotan
se cansan,
ella ni lo nota
porque esta ciega,
ciega de amor

Pero no aguanta la monotonía
ya no quería ser dueño de una sola tía
o eso le decía a sus colegas de copas

''Yo salgo con otras,pero ella ni lo nota''

Bella estaba ciega
pero no era tonta,
ya dudaba

Tantas noches sola
cuantas horas de la madrugada

La primera vez fue la mas dolorosa,
te regaló una infidelidad por cada rosa
y es que el perdón será tu debilidad
pero lo que pasa una vez
siempre sufre de una vez más

[Estribillo]

Este cuento no es eterno
debo salir ponerle un fin
ser más fuerte que esa bestia
debo salir
quiero vivir
quiero vivir

[Norykko]

Tantas cicatrices ya no puedo más
me duelen las entrañas
de tanto sangrar..

No existe un maquillaje que pueda tapar
este moretón que es mi corazón
Ya no se cuánto más tiempo podré aguantar
ya no me quedan lágrimas para llorar
el peso de estos años me doblan la edad
En cada rincón tengo un moretón

Dime que esto no ha pasado
tu dime que el barrio ha olvidado
mañana todo habrá cambiado
y esto será sólo un horrible recuerdo

Sé que me quieres mi vida
yo sé que no habra más heridas
mañana sera un nuevo día
Y otra vez seremos felices de nuevo

[Porta]

Empiezan las discuciones,
parece que a él no le gustan,
se vuelve insensible y agresivo
y a Bella le asusta

Lágrimas caían,tras un empujón
y el primer puñetazo,
te conformas con un perdón
y un simple abrazo

No quieres darle importancia
porque no quieres perderlo
pero sientes impotencia
y a la vez pánico y miedo

No puedes creerlo todavía,
después de tantos años
''Te preguntas por qué te has caído en el puente''

El silencio no te ayuda,
sé que no sabes que hacer,
sabes que fue la primera
y no será la última vez

Créeme sé que no quieres más problemas
pero no te quedes en silencio
si tu marido te pega

Porque no le perteneces,
te mereces mucho más
Ese cretino tienen autoridad
se la das y él se crece

No puedes detenerle,
no puedes defenderte,
no puedes hacer más que rezar por tener suerte

Cada día más normal
pasar del amor al odio,
se convirtió en algo habitual
otro mal episodio

Bestia no te quiere
pero quiere que seas suya
para siempre

''¡Si no eres mía,no serás de nadie entiendes!''

Bella no podía más,
el cada día era más bestia

Cuando ella quiso hablar
ya era demasiado tarde,
se dio cuenta que vivía junto al mal
'La Bella y la Bestia''
Prefiero no contaros el final

[Estribillo]

Este cuento no es eterno
debo salir ponerle un fin
ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
quiero vivir
quiero vivir

[Norykko]

Tu final atravesó mi alma en sólo un compás
callaste mis lamentos con brutalidad
me has convertido en un triste numero más
Tu triste corazón fue tu perdición

Es demasiado tarde para ir hacia atrás
no volveré a tener otra oportunidad
seré sólo un mal día en la prensa local
Pero mi dolor será tu prisión

Y si yo ahora puediera cambiar en algo tus miserias
daría todo porque entendieras
sólo un segundo de mi sufrimiento

Espero que al menos mi historia
no quede sólo en la memoria
Y traiciona nuestra trayectoria,
Que no se repita jamás este cuento

[Estribillo]

Este cuento no es eterno
debo ponerle un fin(¡Porta!)
ser más fuerte que esa bestia(¡Norykko!)
Quiero salir
quiero vivir(Trastorno Bipolar)

Sé más fuerte que esa Bestia
debes salir,
vuelve a vivir

(La Bella y la Bestia)

Sé más fuerte,
camina hacia adelante,
no te rindas,
no te quedes en silencio..",9190,309,0,0,189382,2010-09-30 01:34:00,0,"La bella y la bestia, porta, letra, casi angeles, mar, thiago, thiaguella, marianella",La Bella Y La Bestia - Porta,QXWNrTAve9Q,65327126,CGQQAA,y,0,10,9,30,273,3,7.815093552269158,4.144169300041666,5.27733869867906,3.963315511386112,7,39,-0.13541666666666666,556,0.0,7,0.0,6,0,5,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0.6752751791623472,0.5302776316527116,1.3315464498140317,0,0,3.0

Escucho el comentario 
De todos mis amigos 
Que me hallan diferente 
Estoy tan destruido 

Que apenas soy la sombra 
Soy un desconocido 
Que a veces ni respondo 
Que ya no soy el mismo 

Y todos siempre piensan 
Saber más de la cuenta 
Lo sienten, lo conversan 
Y de ello se alimentan 

Mientras que la sangre aquí en mi corazón 
Va subiendo arriba la temperatura 
Mientras mi locura, va con tu cordura 
Mientras yo te extrañe, yo te sienta, yote ame 

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer 
Yo no te olvido mujer 

Quizá yo le pido al 
amor demasiado 
Quizá por exceso y 
demás he pecado 
Quizá por costumbre, 
tal vez por temores 
No sé porque sí no sé si hay 
razones 

Quizá por demencia, 
piedad o clemencia 
Quizá por amarte, por 
necesitarte 
Quizá porque lejos de 
tí es demasiado 
Quizá porque todas
mis necesidades las tengo de tí mientras yo te ame 

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer 
Yo no te olvido mujer 
Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer 
Yo no te olvido mujer 

Y yo aquí muriendo y 
tú como si nada 
Pero la razón me vuelve a controlar 
Y dentro de mí es el 
dolor que habla 
Que conversa a solas con mi soledad 

Vienes, te apareces y te veo 
Y es que aquí no pasa 
el tiempo 
Y yo muriendo 

Yo intento pero nunca salgo del abismo (y todo queda en nada)
Mis gritos hacen eco al fondo de la nada (mientras mi cuerpo)
Mientras mi cuerpo se resiste a caer 
Yo no te olvido mujer 
Yo intento, yo intento, yo intento, salir del abismo (y todo queda en nada)

Pinocho
LETRA
Hasta el viejo hospital de los muñecos
llegó el pobre Pinocho mal herido
porque un cruel espantapájaros bandido
lo sorprendió dormido y lo atacó

Llego con su nariz hecha pedazos
un pierna en tres partes astillada
una lesión interna y delicada
que el médico de guardia no atendió

A un viejo cirujano llamaron por urgencia
y con su vieja ciencia pronto lo remendó
pero dijo a lo otros muñecos internados
todo esto será en vano le falta el corazón

El caso es que Pinocho estaba grave
y en sí de su desmayo no volvía
y el viejo cirujano no sabía
a quién pedir prestado un corazón

Entonces llegó el Hada Protectora
y viendo que Pinocho se moría
le puso un corazón de fantasía
y Pinocho sonriendo despertó
y Pinocho sonriendo despertó
y Pinocho sonriendo despertó

Letra de Cara a Cara y Te Deseo:

Solamente una palabra
Solamente una oración
Cuando llegue a tu presencia 
Oh Señor

No me importa en qué lugar
De la mesa me hagas sentar
Y el color de mi corona
Si la llego a ganar

Solamente una palabra
Si es que aún me queda voz
Y si logro articularla
Tu presencia

No te quiero hacer preguntas
Solo una petición
Y si puede ser a solas, 
Mucho mejor

Solo déjame mirarte cara a cara
Y perderme como un niño en tu mirada
Y que pase mucho tiempo, y que nadie diga nada
Porque estoy viendo, al Maestro cara a cara.

Que se ahogue en mi recuerdo, en tu mirada
Quiero amarte en el silencio, y sin palabras
Y que pase mucho tiempo, y que nadie diga nada
Solo déjame mirarte cara a cara

Si mis tesoros han perdido todo su valor
Y en este mundo ya no encuentro más satisfacción
Es porque he probado y he podido ver
A Cristo Jesús

Si todo es nada comparado a lo que hay en ti
Lo que estimaba ya no es importante para mi
Es porque he probado y he podido ver
A Cristo Jesús, A Cristo Jesús

//Te deseo, más que a la vida
Te deseo, más cada día
Te deseo, más todavía
Jesús//

Cuando caiga ante tus plantas, de rodillas
Déjame llorar pegado a tus heridas
Y que pase mucho tiempo, y que nadie me lo impida
Que he esperado este momento, toda mi vida

La mayor parte de la música en este canal puede ser utilizada como música para conciliar un sueño profundo. Si sufre de insomnio o si tiene problemas para relajarse después de un largo día, espero que esta música le pueda ayudar. Para garantizar que pueda dormirse de manera rápida, la música cuenta con instrumentos suaves que son tocados en un patrón lento y repetitivo. Debido a esto, la música también puede ser utilizada como música de meditación y como música para estudiar. El solo hecho de que la música relajante no tenga tantas variaciones, hace posible que sus pensamientos vaguen sin distraerse demasiado por la música.

Muchas de las grabaciones cuentan con efectos de sonido relajantes grabados en la naturaleza. Cierre los ojos y camine en un bosque tranquilo, descanse en la playa o simplemente escuche el suave viento.  Río Azul se esfuerza continuamente para hacer la mejor música relajante posible y para satisfacer sus necesidades. Para ofrecer una buena experiencia, todas las grabaciones están llenas de hermosas fotos o vídeos de la naturaleza. Todo esto está destinado para llevarlo a un estado de profunda relajación.

Depuis 15 ans, Hradcany puise son imaginaire dans les modes de jeu qui caractérisent les musiques populaires de l’Est méditerranéen. Dans une grande complicité, ces trois musiciens proposent un parcours initiatique et festif, transcendé par l’apport d’une écriture d’aujourd’hui, mettant au premier plan l’expression de ces solistes-improvisateurs.

Over the last 15 years, Hradcany draws its imagination from popular music from Eastern Europe. Collectively, these three musicians propose an initiatory and festive journey transcended by the contribution of a contemporary musical composition, bringing to the forefront the expression of these soloists-improvisers.

Tras el éxito de su single ‘Noviembre’, Rulo y la Contrabanda presenta su nuevo single '32 escaleras' para el que cuenta con la colaboración de su amigo Dani Martín. El videoclip de la canción está rodado en la azotea de la Torre Europa de Madrid 120 metros del suelo y dirigido por Mario Ruiz de Krea Films. Con el lanzamiento de su nuevo disco 'El doble de tu mitad' Rulo y la Contrabanda volvió a alcanzar el puesto más alto de la lista oficial de ventas después de hacerlo con su disco debut. Su tercer trabajo 'El doble de tu mitad' se publicó pasado 14  octubre, cuatro años después de su último disco, e incluye 11 nuevas canciones producidas por Carlos Raya, productor de Fito&Fitipaldis, Leiva o M-Clan entre otros. 'El doble de tu mitad' es el disco celebrante, purificador y luminoso de alguien que atraviesa un momento de dicha personal y profesional y no puede evitar contárnoslo cantándolo. Belleza como la contenida en este disco, en donde están, vivísimos, el rock de los perfectos contrarios y el rock del deseo. Rock sólido y revitalizador. Rock para reír y cantar y no dejar de moverse, pero también para pensar y emocionarse. Rulo y su inseparable Contrabanda, continua con la gira presentación del disco que ya ha pasado por Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Sevilla, Burgos, Valladolid, Santiago de Compostela, Zaragoza, Vitoria, León, Zamora, Valencia, Salamanca, Gijón, Santander, Madrid y Barcelona y al otro lado del charco en México, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile y Argentina.

I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love

Tekst utworu:

dzwonili od rana, że w nocy mam lot,
że to bardzo pilne i właśnie mnie chcą
rakieta już czeka, człowieka im brak
człowieka z gitarą, to wszystko co mam
i dali skafander - perłowa biel
z pojemną butlą z napisem tlen
wsadzili w kabinę, odliczyli „trzy!”
i już lecę w kosmos, a na dole ty
czekasz ty, czekasz ty
czekasz ty, czekasz ty...
sikałem w torebki, jadłem jak pies,
a eksperyment przeciągał się
jedyną radością był kosmiczny gig
tak na to wołałem otwierając drzwi
na orbicie dźwięk przeszywał nicość,
a gitary gryf był mi kotwicą, na dnie
i choć na dole świat to był żart
to w tym mrowisku gdzieś daleko tam
czekasz ty, czekasz ty
czekasz ty, czekasz ty...
 
już nie mam jak
wylądować, poczuć grunt
zapomnieli o mnie ci
co dali tlen, wysłali gdzieś
 
i choć na dole świat to jest żart
to w tym mrowisku gdzieś daleko tam

Pasteur Gregory Toussaint est né en Haïti, dans la commune de Carrefour, banlieue sud de Port-au-Prince, la capitale. A Queens, New-York, Gregory Toussaint achèvera ses études universitaires au York College. Parallèlement, c'est à la même époque qu'il allait vraiment remettre sa vie à Christ. « Quand j'étais en Haïti, j'allais à l'église juste pour faire plaisir à mon père, mais je n'étais pas encore sauvé. Je n'avais pas pris personnellement la décision de suivre Christ », se rappelle celui qui est aujourd'hui l'un des pasteurs haïtiens les plus connus de la Diaspora. Aujourd'hui, il dirige l'église Tabernacle de Gloire qu'il avait fondée avec sa femme Patricia fin 2006, à Miami. Il indique être venu au ministère pastoral « par souci de voir des vies changer ».

« Après plus d'une quinzaine d'années à évangéliser à travers le monde, je remarquais parfois que je pouvais prêcher pendant 10 ans dans une église et je n'apercevais pas beaucoup de changements, ou du moins je n'étais pas présent assez longtemps pour vivre ces changements. C'était pour moi un sujet d'insatisfaction dans mon ministère d'évangéliste ».

Aujourd'hui, le pasteur Gregory Toussaint se réjouit de voir ce désir comblé dans le ministère pastoral. « J'ai pu voir des vies transformées par le message de l'Évangile. Certains jeunes étaient des prostituées, des drogués, des membres de gangs et grâce à la Parole de Dieu, ils ont eu une nouvelle vie. D'autres étaient rejetés par les églises traditionnelles parce qu'ils avaient commis une erreur de jeunesse. Ces jeunes avaient abandonné l'église, mais ils sont venus au Tabernacle de Gloire car on s'est gardé de les juger sans pour autant justifier leurs actes ».
