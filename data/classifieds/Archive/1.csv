Lyrics
Listen as your day unfolds,
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears,
Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view,
My oh my, heh, hey

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Time asks no questions,
It goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning
Can't stop it, if you try to
The best part is danger staring you in the face

Remember, listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears,
My oh my heh, hey, hey

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together

BTS, beloved all over the world for their ""The Most Beautiful Moment in Life"" album series in 2015, will release a special album [The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Young Forever] on May 2. [The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Young Forever] is the final album of ""The Most Beautiful Moment in Life"" series. It wraps up the story about the threatening reality (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life pt.1) and the young generation striving forward in it (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life pt.2).
The title song ""FIRE"" is a globally trendy electro trap track. Unlike the previous sentimental songs in ""The Most Beautiful Moment in Life"" series, like ""I NEED U"", ""RUN"", or ""Butterfly"", this song shows BTS's wild and energetic side as did ""DOPE"" and ""War of Hormone"".

2015年、青春2部作「花様年華」シリーズで、国内外を問わず熱い愛を受けた防弾少年団が、
5月2日スペシャルアルバム『花様年華Young Forever』をリリースする。
『花様年華Young Forever』は、「花様年華」シリーズの大長征を終えるスペシャルアルバムで、
不安で危うい現実(花様年華pt.1)の中で前を向いて走っていく(花様年華pt.2)青春たちの最後の話が盛り込まれている。

タイトル曲「燃え浮上る(FIRE)」は、全世界で流行っているElectro Trapジャンルの曲で、
これまで花様年華シリーズで披露した「I NEED U」や「RUN」、「Butterfly」などの感性的な曲とは違って、
「DOPE」 、「ホルモン戦争」のように防弾少年団のワイルドながらもエネルギッシュな姿を存分に発揮する。

2015년 한 해 청춘 2부작 ‘화양연화’ 시리즈로 국내외를 막론하고 뜨거운 사랑을 받은 방탄소년단이 5월 2일 스페셜 앨범 [화양연화 Young Forever]를 발매한다. [화양연화 Young Forever]는 ‘화양연화’ 시리즈의 대장정을 마무리하는 스페셜 앨범으로, 불안하고 위태로운 현실(화양연화 pt.1) 속에서도 앞을 향해 달려 나가는(화양연화 pt.2) 청춘들의 마지막 이야기가 담겨 있다.

타이틀곡 ‘불타오르네 (FIRE)’는 전세계를 휩쓸고 있는 Electro Trap 장르의 곡으로, 그간 화양연화 시리즈를 통해 선보였던 ‘I NEED U’나 ‘RUN’, ‘Butterfly’ 등 감성적인 곡들과는 달리 ‘쩔어’, ‘호르몬전쟁’처럼 방탄소년단의 와일드하면서도 에너제틱한 면모를 마음껏 발휘한다.",162517,295,0,0,4382740,2016-05-01 15:00:00,0,"Kpop, 1theK, 원더케이, loen, 로엔, 뮤비, 티져, MV, Teaser, 신곡, new, song, 한류, hallyu, ロエン, ミュージック, ミュージックビデオ, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, 韓流, 韓国, 아이돌, idol, 방탄소년단, 컴백, 에필로그, 영 포에버, 빅히트, bts, comeback, epilogue, young forever, 화양연화, 花樣年華, bighit, bts mv, bts i need u, bts run, bts jin, bts jimin, bts rapmonster, bts jungguk, bts v, bts sugar, 방탄, 랩몬, 랩몬스터, 뷔, 방탄소년단 지민, 방탄소년단 슈가, run mv, bts dope, 방탄소년단 쩔어, bts boy in luv, 방탄소년단 상남자, 방탄소년단 군무, bts choregraphy, 防弾少年団",[MV] BTS(방탄소년단) _ FIRE (불타오르네),ALj5MKjy2BU,422845815,CGQQAA,a,0,16,5,1,122,6,8.626182036638527,5.66218531871293,6.641745707497551,5.210898796822779,8,17,0.4203612479474548,233,0.11818181818181818,58,0.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0.7699519531685797,0.656395296860601,1.2745873536341177,1,0,1.0

LYRICS (by Guillaume Héritier & Fkj) :

I’m in the right direction
I mean to ride this ocean
Travelling in slow motion
Paddling with no question

Early morning with the sun
Not yet burning, innocent
I try to be a good son
Myself one hundred per cent

I feel it inside
I wanna reach that 
It's somewhere in sight
I wish I'd reach that

Skyline x2

Skyline x2
I wish I'd reach
Skyline x2
I'm gonna reach that 
Skyline x2

Endless troubles to go through
They are strewn in the city
Daily struggle to be true
Betrayed authenticity

Poison world around but still
I will take another round
Or another ride until
We take off from the ground

I feel it inside
I wanna reach that 
It's somewhere in sight
I wish I'd reach that

Skyline x2
I wanna reach that 
Skyline x2
I wish I'd reach

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

J’veux pas rater l’but, c’est ce que vivent les surveillants dans les stades

Quand j’étais petit j’voulais être grand grand grand
Faire mes preuves sans les gants gants gants
Face aux chiens j’sors les dents dents dents 
Quand le succès vient il y a des gens gens gens

J’débarque dans ta life et vu l’ambiance,
J’crois qu’on est loin de la romance

Tous les membres de l’équipe, sont des putain de phénomène
Les puristes veulent pas que j’rappe, je le fais quand même

Lyrics:

You saw me standing by the wall corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go
Don't save a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after
Feel the breeze deep on the inside look you down into the well
If you can you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after (doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Save a prayer 'til the morning after

Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
Well every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment

LYRICS:
STAND UP FOR SOMETHING

You can have all the money in your hands
All the possessions anyone can ever have
But it's all worthless treasure
True worth is only measured not by what you got
But what you got in your heart
You can have, you can have everything
But what does it, what does it mean

It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I'll stand up for you
And I'll stand up for you 
yes I will, yes I will

You do the best to do the best that you can do
Then you can look in the mirror 
proud of who's looking back at you
Define the life you're living
Not by what you take but what you're giving
And if you bet on love no way you'll ever lose
take a stand, make a stand for what's right
It's always worth, always worth the fight

‘Cuz It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
and I'll stand up for you

Self respect, dignity
If that's all you got
Then you got all you need
And without that you don't have a thing

It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
and I'll stand up for you",816,227,0,1,31101,2017-10-12 18:33:00,0,"Andra, Warner, Bros., day, records, diane, warren, common, marshall, thurgood, soundtrack, justice, equality, #standupforsomething, stand up for something",Andra Day - Stand Up For Something feat.

From 1982 Album: ""The Message""...(Click ""show more"" for artist info)...

DJ Grandmaster Flash and his group the Furious Five were hip-hop's greatest innovators, transcending the genre's party-music origins to explore the full scope of its lyrical and sonic horizons. Flash was born Joseph Saddler in Barbados on January 1, 1958; he began spinning records as teen growing up in the Bronx, performing live at area dances and block parties. By age 19, while attending technical school courses in electronics during the day, he was also spinning on the local disco circuit; over time, he developed a series of groundbreaking techniques including ""cutting"" (moving between tracks exactly on the beat), ""back-spinning"" (manually turning records to repeat brief snippets of sound), and ""phasing"" (manipulating turntable speeds) — in short, creating the basic vocabulary which DJs continue to follow even today.

Flash did not begin collaborating with rappers until around 1977, first teaming with the legendary Kurtis Blow. He then began working with the Furious Five — rappers Melle Mel (Melvin Glover), Cowboy (Keith Wiggins), Kid Creole (Nathaniel Glover), Mr. Ness aka Scorpio (Eddie Morris), and Rahiem (Guy Williams); the group quickly became legendary throughout New York City, attracting notice not only for Flash's unrivalled skills as a DJ but also for the Five's masterful rapping, most notable for their signature trading and blending of lyrics. Despite their local popularity, they did not record until after the Sugarhill Gang's smash ""Rapper's Delight"" proved the existence of a market for hip-hop releases; after releasing ""We Rap More Mellow"" as the Younger Generation, Flash and the Five recorded ""Superappin'"" for the Enjoy label owned by R&B legend Bobby Robinson. They then switched to Sugar Hill, owned by Sylvia Robinson (no relation), after she promised them an opportunity to rap over a current DJ favorite, ""Get Up and Dance"" by Freedom (the idea had probably been originally conceived by Crash Crew for their single ""High Powered Rap"").

That record, 1980's ""Freedom,"" the group's Sugar Hill debut, reached the Top 20 on national R&B charts on its way to selling over 50,000 copies; its follow-up, ""Birthday Party,"" was also a hit. 1981's ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"" was the group's first truly landmark recording, introducing Flash's ""cutting"" techniques to create a stunning sound collage from snippets of songs by Chic, Blondie, and Queen. Flash and the Five's next effort, 1982's ""The Message,"" was even more revelatory — for the first time, hip-hop became a vehicle not merely for bragging and boasting but for trenchant social commentary, with Melle Mel delivering a blistering rap detailing the grim realities of life in the ghetto. The record was a major critical hit, and it was an enormous step in solidifying rap as an important and enduring form of musical expression.

Following 1983's anti-cocaine polemic ""White Lines,"" relations between Flash and Melle Mel turned ugly, and the rapper soon left the group, forming a new unit also dubbed the Furious Five. After a series of Grandmaster Flash solo albums including 1985's They Said It Couldn't Be Done, 1986's The Source, and 1987's Da Bop Boom Bang, he reformed the original Furious Five lineup for a charity concert at Madison Square Garden; soon after, the reconstituted group recorded a new LP, 1988's On the Strength, which earned a lukewarm reception from fans and critics alike. Another reunion followed in 1994, when Flash and the Five joined a rap package tour also including Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C. A year later, Flash and Melle Mel also appeared on Duran Duran's cover of ""White Lines."" Except for a few compilations during the late '90s, Flash was relatively quiet until 2002, when a pair of mix albums appeared: The Official Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on Strut and Essential Mix: Classic Edition on ffrr.

Lyrics:

Heard about my past 
Things I used to do
The games I used to play 
The girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind
You think I'm doing wrong
Can I say what is real 
You are the only one
When I'm not around 
Do you think of me
Or what the jealous ones
Are claiming me to be
You should know by now 
That it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you
For us to make it through

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy

블락비가 5th Mini Album ‘Blooming Period’로 돌아왔다.

블락비는 지난 3월 리드싱글 ‘몇 년 후에’를 통해 감성적인 음악과 새로운 모습을 선보였다. ‘몇 년 후에’는 발매 직후 주요 음원차트 1위를 휩쓸며 이번 미니앨범에 대한 기대감을 높였다.

본 앨범은 마치 ‘개화기’ 와 같은 작품이다. 다양한 기후의 사계를 겪고 만개하는 꽃처럼 만발하는 감성을 담았다. 그 동안 블락비는 눈보라나 강한 햇빛과도 같은 강렬함을 보여줬다. 하지만 이 시기를 지난 7명의 남자는 다소 정적이지만 의미 있는 감성을 가지고 새롭게 만개했다.

TESTO:
Forse si... Forse no...
Forse si... Forse non lo so...

Ascolti Vasco ventiquattr’ore 
Sei chiara come un Alba all’equatore
Respiri piano per non far rumore 
Copriti gli occhi che ti si vede il cuore 
Tu mi spogli l’anima e mi riempi il viso
Come gli abbracci da dietro all’improvviso
E quando penso al tuo sorriso... ah 
I sorrisi diventano due... Narciso.
Se mi specchio vedo solo errori
Ma con te mi sento perfetto
Se i nostri sogni sono la fuori
Siamo noi quelli nel cassetto 
Ti senti persa quando sei a un bivio?
Io così spesso che ci morirò 
Ma sai la regola dell'equilibrio
È che ogni tanto devi perderlo un po’.

Forse si... forse no...
Forse si... forse no...
Perché i dubbi che hai 
Sono i dubbi che ho 
E i difetti che hai
Sono il meglio che ho
Senza PhotoShop

UNA VITA SENZA PHOTOSHOP 
DAMMI UN RICORDO SENZA PHOTOSHOP 
SE TI GUARDI E NON TI SENTI AL TOP? 
SEI PIÙ BELLA SENZA PHOTOSHOP 

A te non serve... photoshop
Tutti vogliono... foto shock 
Perché si sentono... poco rock, poco top, poco... wow!
Chi è senza peccato, peccato
Il tempo che passa tra un bacio e l’altro... è tempo sprecato
Il mio cuore c’ha la testa dura
Tu sei la cura
Battiato sushi e tempura
Tu mi spogli l’anima e mi riempi il viso
Come gli abbracci da dietro all’improvviso
E quando penso al tuo sorriso... ah 
I sorrisi diventano due... Narciso.

Forse si... forse no
Forse si... forse non lo so...
Perché i dubbi che hai 
Sono i dubbi che ho 
E i difetti che hai
Sono il meglio che ho

Tribute to the great Van Cliburn who passed away on 27 Feb 2013.

-Biography- 

Harvey Lavan ""Van"" Cliburn, Jr., (July 12, 1934 -- February 27, 2013) has been called an American hero, hailed as one of the most persuasive ambassadors of American culture as well as one of the greatest pianists in the history of music. With his historic 1958 victory in the first Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition in Moscow at the height of the Cold War, Van Cliburn tore down cultural barriers years ahead of glasnost and perestroika, reaching out across political frontiers with a universal message all could greet with joy: the message of beautiful music.

Cliburn was the first musician ever honored with a ticker-tape parade in New York City, a true hero's welcome and a show of gratitude for an American victory on the heels of the Soviet Union's launching of Sputnik. Again reaching across cultural borders, Cliburn invited the Russian conductor Kirill Kondrashin to come to New York and reprise the performances that had earned the young American the gold medal in Moscow. Cliburn's recording of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Kondrashin became the first classical album to reach platinum status and has gone on to sell more than three million copies

The legendary Emil Gilels, one of the judges who awarded Cliburn the top prize in Moscow in 1958, said at the time ""his inborn artistry and subtle musicianship ennoble all that he plays. His victory at such a difficult contest may be truly termed brilliant.'' A few years later, in his classic study of the world's great pianists, Harold C. Schoenberg noted that ""of all the Americans of his generation, Cliburn was able to produce the most sensuous of sounds ... rich, never percussive, a real piano sound that reminded old-timers of the great romantic pianists of the past.''

Van Cliburn was born in Louisiana on July 12, 1934, the son of Harvey Lavan Cliburn and Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn. The family moved to Texas when the boy was only six, and by 12 the prodigy had won every major local piano competition. His Carnegie Hall debut in 1954, playing the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 under Dmitri Mitropolous' baton, offered the music world a preview of what would become his signature piece and the occasion of his Moscow victory four years later.

Cliburn's ties to the grand romantic school of piano were close from the start of his career: His only teacher for the first 17 years of his life was his indomitable mother, herself a pupil of Arthur Friedheim, who was a pupil of Franz Liszt. Later, at the Juilliard School, the young pianist studied at his mother's urging with the acclaimed Russian pedagogue Rosina Lhevinne. ""Van was so teachable,'' recalled a proud Mrs. Cliburn in 1958, ""and always so respectful and quick to learn.''

He learned fast, and his love and respect for great music only grew. Tours all over the world followed his Tchaikovsky Competition triumph, a growing series of definitive recordings added to his popularity, and even a decade-long sabbatical from public performances only increased the disarming directness of his romantic touch when he returned to the concert circuit in 1987. In honor of Cliburn's return to the concert stage, the eight-disc Van Cliburn Collection was released on the RCA Victor label, containing many of Cliburn's classic concerto recordings: Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1; Rachmaninoff Concertos Nos. 2 and 3; Prokofiev Concerto No. 3; Brahms' Concerto No. 2; and Rachmaninoff's ""Variations on a Theme of Paganini."" His current touring schedule includes performances across the country from Tanglewood to Thousand Oaks, California.

Cliburn has performed for royalty, heads of state in Europe, Asia, and South America and for every President of the United States since Harry Truman.

Cliburn's selfless devotion to music has been expressed in other ways as well. At the height of his early career, Cliburn made time to encourage and nourish young talent with the first Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. First held in 1962, this competition is held in Fort Worth every four years. It is an integral part of Cliburn's living legacy, a bright and hopeful signpost for the future of American music.

Đây cũng là nơi – Only C và ShiGGa Shay – hai nghệ sĩ đến từ hai đất nước đã gặp nhau, trao đổi cảm hứng, và bắt tay nhau làm nên một tác phẩm âm nhạc, kết hợp hoàn hảo giữa phong cách Pop trẻ trung và Underground Hiphop bụi bặm. Bài hát mang vẻ đẹp pha trộn của một Singapore vừa hào nhoáng xa hoa, vừa thân thuộc và đầy cá tính.

Đôi chân ngao du muôn nơi muốn thấy hết những thú vui xa xôi chân trời mới
Bạn bè giao du lôi ta đi xa, lòng tìm về một nơi không vướng thêm bụi đường
Tại vì sao không buông đi âu lo ta bắt máy lên alo cho bạn tốt
Vậy thì Singapore ngay luôn đi còn ngại ngần điều chi không đắn đo nhiều lời

Get on top, watch the city shine
Bright lights through the skyline
We could go where the sun rise
From the Bay Sands, you can see the stars anytime 
You can start wishing now
Make a wish upon the stars or the wishing well 
Go anywhere for your eyes to see
As long as you, got the heart to believe

Thích ăn gì, thích chơi gì, thích nâng vài ly phiêu du thuyền lướt sóng
Thích la cà, thích shopping, hẹn hò cùng nhau hết lấc nguyên cả ngày
Thích âm nhạc, hát ca nào, đứng ngay quầy bar chilling nhạc sống nhé 
Lỡ mai già, hết sức đi
Kỷ niệm ngày hôm nay chúng ta đã từng

Hôm nay skinny sơ mi cho khác với những thứ 2 ưu tư trong bộ vest
Tạm biệt suy tư trong con tim ta chẳng còn bận tâm lo lắng hay phiền muộn
Tại vì sao không Chinatown ngay ăn hết món ngon cho no nê một chút
Tại vì sao không say sưa đêm nay mình cùng hẹn nhau nhâm nhi hết chai rồi về

They say the sky is the limit 
Can’t waste any minute 
celebrate if you with it
Party all night at Zouk
just admit it when you live it
Ay, tell ya homies it’s time
Let go and we can unwind
Losin’ control of your mind
You gon’ wanna hit rewind
When you’re having fun it’s a sign

Thích ăn gì, thích chơi gì, thích nâng vài ly phiêu du thuyền lướt sóng
Thích la cà, thích shopping, hẹn hò cùng nhau hết lấc nguyên cả ngày

Lỡ mai già, hết sức đi
Kỷ niệm ngày hôm nay chúng ta đã từng

Cuộc đời có mấy khi được say mấy khi được bên nhau vui chơi hết ngày
Ngày mai nếu có bên cạnh nhau cớ sao lại không nhắc đến hôm nay

Paint the whole city red what you want you get

Thích ăn gì, thích chơi gì, thích nâng vài ly phiêu du thuyền lướt sóng

Never thought we could feel so alive 
Now we here homie, we survived 
Hard times, take a chance to breathe 
We all need one heart to believe

Quintet for 2 violins, viola & 2 cellos in C major, D. 956 (Op. posth. 163), written in 1828.

The work is the only full-fledged string quintet in Schubert's oeuvre. It consists of four movements:
00:00 - I. Allegro ma non troppo
15:42 - II. Adagio
29:11 - III. Scherzo. Presto
31:45 ---------------Trio. Andante sostenuto
36:14 ---------------Scherzo
38:43 - IV. Allegretto

Benjamin Britten once suggested that ""the richest and most productive eighteen months in music history"" were ""the period in which Franz Schubert wrote Winterreise, the C major symphony, his last three piano sonatas, the C Major String Quintet, as well as a dozen other glorious pieces."" The String Quintet, D. 956 is certainly one of the pinnacles of the chamber music canon, and is often cited as a significant example of the composer's legacy: it was composed in the summer of 1828, just two months before his death.

Certainly in the period between the death of his idol, Beethoven, and his own passing, the 31-year-old Schubert achieved a breakthrough in large-scale forms the likes of which has not been seen since. But the Quintet strikes one more as young man's music than as a summary statement; there is a youthful ambition that is not unlike that of Beethoven's first string quartets.

For his scoring, Schubert went against the model of Mozart and Beethoven, who each added a second viola to the conventional string quartet for their quintets; Boccherini provided the only precedent for using two cellos. Schubert uses the second cello to create dense and varied textures: sometimes the cello serves as a second bass instrument under a full quartet, sometimes it's a bass-rich quartet sans violin, and sometimes there is a rich interplay between instrumental sections.

The first two movements have an expansive and deliberate buildup that seems to anticipate the sprawling structures of Anton Bruckner. But in most ways the piece remains quite conventional; it retains the standard four-movement format, and has an energetic scherzo (though a more wistful trio) and a zestful, almost Hungarian finale. Despite the bleak spaces of the slow movement, these movements suggest a youth's first steps into maturity, and the work as a whole serves as a tantalizing reminder of what might have been, had Schubert been granted more time to create and innovate.

I'd recommend a video on YT called 'Schubert Adagio ""The Entrance to Heaven""', where you can listen to Rubinstein's admiration for this string quintet.",24,2939,0,0,499,2015-12-08 00:35:11,0,,"Franz Schubert - String Quintet in C major, D. 956",DJ-vroCJvzo,87193,CGQQAA,c,0,15,12,8,342,1,4.940481620444029,1.6020599913279625,2.6981005456233897,1.3802112417116061,4,50,0.14560335497835494,429,0.0,0,0.0625,9,0,2,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,1,50,0.5461209559931318,0.3242720273866693,1.9548460873840323,0,0,1.0

II:   Dm7   I   G7    I   Cmaj7   I   Cmaj7   :II  


In theory, the C major scale works throughout!

C major scale - C D E F G A B 

Next up, I'd try outlining the chord tones/arpeggios:

Cmaj7 arpeggio = c e g b 

Dmin7 arpeggio = d f a c 

G7 arpeggio = g b d f 

Playing C Major scale will result in C Ionian (Cmaj7 chords), D Dorian (Dm7 chords) and G Mixolydian (G7 chords) - all the same 7 notes!

Next up, I'd recommend trying out some more advanced colours on the dominant chord (G7/G13) by using the 

G diminished 1/2-1 tone scale = G Ab Bb B C# D E F (G)

0,Bartje Bartmans,66,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Georges Bizet (25 October 1838 – 3 June 1875), registered at birth as Alexandre César Léopold Bizet, was a French composer of the romantic era. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.

Symphony in C Major (1855)

1. Allegro vivo
2. Andante. Adagio (10:52)
3. Allegro vivace (20:26)
4. Finale. Allegro vivace (25:55)

Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Bernhard Haitink

The Symphony in C is an early work by the French composer Georges Bizet. According to Grove's Dictionary, the symphony ""reveals an extraordinarily accomplished talent for a 17-year-old student, in melodic invention, thematic handling and orchestration.""  Bizet started work on the symphony on 29 October 1855, four days after turning 17, and finished it roughly a month later. It was written while he was studying at the Paris Conservatoire under the composer Charles Gounod, and was evidently a student assignment. Bizet showed no apparent interest in having it performed or published, and the piece was never played in his lifetime. He used certain material from the symphony in later works, however. There is no mention of the work in Bizet's letters, and it was unknown to his earlier biographers. His widow, Geneviève Halévy (1849–1926), gave the manuscript to Reynaldo Hahn, who left it along with other papers to the archives of the conservatory library, where it was found in 1933 by Jean Chantavoine. Soon thereafter, Bizet's first British biographer Douglas Charles Parker (1885–1970) showed the manuscript to the conductor Felix Weingartner, who led the first performance in Basel, Switzerland, on 26 February 1935.

The symphony was immediately hailed as a youthful masterpiece on a par with Felix Mendelssohn's overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream, written at about the same age, and quickly became part of the standard Romantic repertoire. It received its first recording on 26 November 1937, by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Walter Goehr.",27,1945,0,0,592,2016-07-27 13:11:40,0,"symphony, orchestra, france, romanticism",Georges Bizet - Symphony in C (1855) [Haitink Concertgebouw],-xk7TVPyboY,77499,CJYBEAA,c,0,16,7,27,209,2,4.88929609867039,1.8195439355418688,2.77232170672292,1.4313637641589874,4,30,0.10765056022408966,331,0.0,3,0.0,8,0,1,1,1,0,5,0,2,1,4,0,1,0,1,4,4,1,0,2,1,3,1,0,1,0,2,1,60,0.5670185750208161,0.3721484440340361,1.9368393808347009,0,0,1.0

0,TheWickedNorth,68,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 in C major, Op. 60 (titled Leningrad), was written c. 1939–40. Initially dedicated to the life and deeds of Vladimir Lenin, Shostakovich decided instead to dedicate the symphony to the city of Leningrad on its completion in December 1941.[1][2] The work remains one of Shostakovich's best-known compositions.

The piece soon became very popular in both the Soviet Union and the West as a symbol of resistance to Nazi totalitarianism and militarism. It is still regarded as the major musical testament of the estimated 25 million Soviet citizens who lost their lives in World War II. The symphony is played frequently at the Leningrad Cemetery, where half a million victims of the 900-day Siege of Leningrad are buried. As a condemnation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the work is particularly representative of the political responsibilities that Shostakovich felt he had for the state, regardless of the conflicts and criticisms he faced throughout his career with Soviet censors and Joseph Stalin.

I fell in love with it instantly the very first time I came across this song; and the moment I learnt how to upload music,  I had no doubt in my mind that one day,  I *will* put this in my channel!

What I'd Say
Earl Thomas Conley

Talkin to the mirror
Whisperin your name
Just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

Hows it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
Your lookin well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say

There's times I feel so angry I'd put my fist right through the wall
Then there's times I've come so close to giving you a call
I love you and I hate you all at the same time
I pray that you'll come back to me before I lose my mind


Hows it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
You're lookin well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say

Guess you'll have to wait until that day
To find out what I'd say

God I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say..",775,234,0,0,15742,2009-03-27 19:55:48,0,"Country, Earl Thomas Conley",What I'd Say by Earl Thomas Conley,kaEWMbItfZE,3130323,CDIQAA,d,0,9,3,27,86,4,6.495589152204663,2.7693773260761385,4.19705990806021,2.88930170250631,6,13,0.00946428571428571,257,0.0,1,0.0,6,0,4,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,34,0.6461399897245176,0.4263473660639676,1.4526208545197932,0,1,1.0

If you're reading this, I have a simple question...

Do you find my work on this channel VALUABLE?

If the answer is yes, wouldn't you say it's worth throwing the creator LESS than what you would spend on a coffee or lose down your sofa cushions?...

In case you don't know, Patreon is a way in which you can support your favourite creators directly with a monthly pledge of as little as a dollar or 2. The security and consistency brought about by this type of support can be completely game-changing for small creators like myself.

By becoming an Elevated patron, you'll get awesome rewards like access to exclusive patron-only jam tracks, your name credited in videos and goodies not available to anyone else, so it's far more than just a donation. 

The goal is simply to be able to keep creating awesome music every day for you guys. But like most small creators, for this I’d rely heavily on your support. So if my work on the channel brings any actual value to your life as a guitarist, musician or otherwise, please consider supporting on Patreon! I'd massively appreciate anything you can offer!

""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" is a song composed and written by Jim Steinman, and recorded by Meat Loaf and Lorraine Crosby. This song was released in 1993 as the first single from the album Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell.

And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'd never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now,
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you ev'ry night of my life, no way
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Girl:]
Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

[Boy:]
I can do that
I can do that

[Girl:]
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

[Boy:]
I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

[Girl:]
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

[Boy:]
I can do that
I can do that

[Girl:]
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

[Boy:]
I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

[Girl:]
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on

[Boy:]
I won't do that
I won't do that

[Girl:]
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

[Boy:]
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Etta James made many appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival across her long and distinguished career from her first concert in 1975 through to her last in 2008. 

This video focuses on the concert from 1975. It features many of her best loved tracks and songs that she is particularly associated with. Etta James was one of the most respected performers of her generation. In a career stretching over 60 years she was inducted into the Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame and the Blues Hall Of Fame, won 3 Grammys and received many more nominations and was named Female Blues Artist Of The Year on no less than 14 occasions. 

Etta James sadly passed away after a long illness in January 2012 and this video is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest female vocalists of the 20th century.",2058,501,0,1,77625,2012-08-14 12:35:37,0,"I'd Rather Be Blind, rather be blind, Etta James, Montreux Jazz Festival, Montreux, Jazz, Rock'n'Roll, Grammys, the Blues Hall of Fame, Hall Of Fame, eagle rock, Live, Performance, concert, dvd, blu ray, eagle vision, music, show, Event, Live Music, Live Concert, Rock Music",Etta James - I'd Rather Be Blind (Live at Montreux 1975),uZt1xKtPbUQ,9276062,CGQQAA,d,0,12,8,14,227,1,6.9673636427438606,3.6784273224338673,4.890001613184637,3.3134453704264133,6,33,0.305,145,-0.1181818181818182,22,-0.18181818181818185,10,0,4,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,5,1,1,0,1,0,0,56,0.7018438915955412,0.5279511033222379,1.4758057147492163,0,0,1.0

Paroles :

Point final, t’as semé sans sonner
Des points d’interrogation
Je passe mon temps à les escalader
Toutes ces, montagnes de questions
Toi ma beauté mon addiction
J'rejoue notre partition
J'coupe les refrains
Où tu dis que j'suis coupable
J'mets mes fausses notes sur la table
Si tu reviens

Oublie au moins
Les mots qui nous freinent
Faisons le vide avant qu'la coupe soit pleine
Reprends la main
Je veux dire la mienne
Faisons le plein pour fuir loin de la peine

(Si) Ton coeur détale
Rupture brutale
Moi l'animal
J'retiens ma respiration
Je compte à rebours
Je guette ton retour
J’suis dans tous mes...
Tous mes états d'amour

Par essence, j'suis un peu pyromane
J'me brûle de tant de questions
Je te promets qu'si tu retrouves la flamme
J'éteins tes hésitations
J'me fais des films en noir et blanc
J'aurai l'Oscar de l'amant
De l'âme en peine
J’préfère largement l'histoire
Où tu m'embrasses au hasard
J'rejoue la scène

Oublie au moins
Les mots qui nous freinent
Faisons le vide avant qu'la coupe soit pleine
Reprends la main
Je veux dire la mienne
Faisons le plein pour fuir loin de la peine

(Si) Ton coeur détale

ZERO เป็นเพลงที่พูดถึงการที่ผู้หญิงที่มักชอบมองว่าผู้ชายไม่ดีเหมือนกันหมด เหมารวมเหมือนปลาเน่าตัวเดียวเหม็นหมด เพลงนี้ถูกแต่งขึ้นมา เพื่อที่จะแสดงจุดยืนให้กับผู้ชายที่รักจริงได้พิสูจน์ตัวเองว่า ยังมีผู้ชายอีกหลายคนที่ไม่เหมือนกับคนเหล่านั้น...

EP. ZERO เป็นการเล่าเรื่องราวของการเริ่มต้นจากศูนย์ แต่ด้วยความเชื่อและความมุ่งมั่นที่หวังจะให้เลขศูนย์นี้มีค่าขึ้นมา แม้เลขศูนย์จะไม่มีค่าในตัวมันเอง แต่เมื่อเลขศูนย์ไปต่อท้ายเลขอะไรก็จะทำให้เลขนั้นมีค่าเพิ่มขึ้นมา เปรียบเหมือนการทำเพลงที่มีผู้ฟังที่ทำจะให้เพลงทุกเพลงมีค่า
เพลงทุกเพลงใน EP นี้ล้วนมาจากประสบการณ์จริงที่มีต่อความรักในแง่มุมต่างๆ ซึ่งเพลงทุกเพลงจะมีตัวตนขึ้นมาได้ ก็ต้องมาจากคนฟังทุกคน เพลงทุกเพลงจะมีคุณค่าได้ ก็ต้องมาจากการที่ทุกคนชอบเพลงเหล่านั้น ซึ่งก็จะทำให้เลขศูนย์ที่เพิ่งเริ่มต้นนั้น มีค่าขึ้นมาได้เช่นกัน

LYRICS:
คุณ..คง... ไม่เคยเจอ กับใครต่อใครที่ คล้ายผม 
เพราะผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใคร,
That's what we're talking about!
ขื่น..ขม..  ตั้งเท่าไหร่..กับพวกผู้ชายเย็นชา..แต่ 
ว่าผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใครเหล่านั้น,That's what we're talking about !
คุณแค่เศร้าหมอง เพราะเค้านั้นเปลี่ยนไป 
แต่ผมนั้นห่วยใย มองมาตรงนี้แล้วเปลี่ยนใจ
ถึงLookผมดูโจร แต่คุณจะปลอดภัย
U never be Alone เพราะว่าผมอยู่ปลอบใจ
มีแค่เราสอง ให้ผมไปกอดใคร 
เพราะสิ่งที่ผมต้องการมีเพียงแค่คุณกับกอดไง
Just wanted you know...
in ya mind , in ya soul , baby
it's the time , to move on , หากเป็นผม , คงดี
หน้าตาไม่ค่อยหล่อแต่รวมๆแล้วมีเสหน์มาก
จะรักใครซักคน...คงต้องบอกว่า Hey ยาก
เชื่อผมได้เลย...คงต้องบอกว่า OKay
You can trust me...เพราะว่าผมไม่ โมเม 
ทำให้คุณสนุก ทำให้รู้สึก (ไม่เบื่อหน่าย)
ไม่มีช่วงโปรโมชั่น Just having Fun (or Retire)
ไม่มีอินโทรดักชั่น มีผมกับคุณand (We Smile) 
จะมีเพียงแค่คำมั่น ว่าผมรักคุณจนวันตาย 
คุณ..คง...  ไม่เคยเจอ กับใครต่อใครที่ คล้ายผม 
เพราะผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใคร,That's what we're talking about!
ขื่น..ขม.. ตั้งเท่าไหร่..กับพวกผู้ชายเย็นชา..แต่ 
ว่าผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใครเหล่านั้น,That's what we're talking about !
คนอื่นนะซิกเเละเเซ็ก เเต่ผมนั้นโคตรจะรีเเล็ก
เธอบอกว่าดีเเต่ก็แปลก เพราะเธอเคยเจอเเต่สุดเเสบ
ที่กระเเทกหัวใจเธอสุด Sad ทำเธอให้เศร้าตั้งเเต่เเรก
เเต่ผมจะเเร๊พให้เธอนะยิ้ม ให้เธอรู้สึก ว่า เเสว๊กเเก็ก 
เเยบ ๆ ไปเเค่นั้น ไอพวกผู้ชาย ที่คุณเจอ
เเละผมจะทำให้คุณรู้ว่ารักของผมต้องลงทุน
มันอาจจะเเลกมาด้วยความสุขจะไม่มีการบ่นว่าขาดทุน
ถ้าหากว่าคุณจะการุณ ก็รับรักอย่าทารุณ กรรม
-ทำเหมือนกับผมเป็นอื่นไป 
ดีเจอราดก็รับประกันว่าไม่มีวันขมขื่นใจ
ไอพวกตัวปลอมที่คุณนะเจอ มันก้ชอบมาหื่นใส่
บ้างก็ลื่นไหล ไก่เเจ้ ดูเเย่ มันไม่เเฟร์ เลยว่าเเมะ
ถึง ไม่ค่อยจะหล่อเเต่ก็ ใช้ใจนะครับ
ไม่มือไวนะครับ รักเเล้วก็คือรัก
จะไม่ทำให้เราต้องอัตคัต ให้มีความสุขซะมากกว่าทุกข์
จะไม่ทำให้เธอรู้สึกติดคุก รักคุนคนเดียว เเล้วจะไม่มีชู้ My Boo!
คุณ..คง...  ไม่เคยเจอ กับใครต่อใครที่ คล้ายผม 
เพราะผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใคร,That's what we're talking about!
ขื่น..ขม.. ตั้งเท่าไหร่..กับพวกผู้ชายเย็นชา..แต่ 
ว่าผมนั้นไม่เหมือนใครเหล่านั้น,That's what we're talking about !

LETRA:
Ai Dede, cê tá vendo?
E ai Rodolfinho, tá vendo ela?
Olha lá!
E aí RD

Chegou sexta-feira ela já tá na bala
Convoca as amigas solteiras, tudo baladeira e partiu pra balada
Sem hora pra voltar pra casa, caprichou no visual
Sainha e blusa decotada
Essa mina me fez passar mal

Taça de Chandon na mão
Sorriso estampado no rosto
Ela desce até o chão
Rebolando e para o baile todo

Olha lá, ela de novo
Tá chapada e não é pouco
Eita bumbum poderoso
Que mexe e requebra gostoso

A CULPA É DELE
(Marília Mendonça)

Ei amiga, senta aqui, que cara é essa aí?
Será que alguém morreu? O que aconteceu?
O que quer me dizer? Por que cê tá chorando?
Eu não tô entendo, cê tá me assustando

Lembro da noite, sim, que a gente saiu
Cê disse que ia ali, logo depois sumiu
Aonde você tava, como assim vou ficar brava?
Que história é essa que aconteceu?

O cara que eu tava deu em cima de você, foi?
E aí você ficou com ele, mas foi uma vez ok
Do que cê tá com medo de estragar a amizade,
Nem fica preocupada, a gente resolve mais tarde

Se quem tava comigo era ele, a culpa dele
Quem fez essa bagunça na nossa amizade é ele
Eu não vou deixar de ser sua amiga por causa de um qualquer
Que não respeita uma mulher

Enxugue esse rosto
E venha aqui fora como de costume 
Vamos conversar 
Que pra te alegrar tem até vagalume
Tem dia que vai piorar 
Saudade vai apertar 
Até que “cê” tá indo bem
Faz falta aqui pra mim também 

Lembra de quando 
Eu ficava acordado até tarde esperando 
Só pra ganhar
Um beijo de boa noite antes de dormir 
Daqui não é diferente 
Te beijo mas você não sente 

Quando bater a saudade 
Olhe aqui pra cima
Sabe lá no céu aquela estrelinha
Que eu muitas vezes mostrei pra você 
Hoje é minha morada
A minha casinha 
Mesmo que de longe tão pequenininha 
Ela brilha mais toda vez que te vê

今作は、歌詞からも想起される鮮やかなヴィジュアルが今にも目に飛び込んでくるような、E-girlsの魅力を全て詰め込んだ楽曲！
イントロの8小節で新時代の幕が開くような期待感と共に鮮やかなサウンドがより一層E-girlsの輝きを増す作品となっています。

ミュージックビデオは、E-girlsとして初めて海外撮影を行った過去最大規模の作品。
アメリカ ラスベガスの地に降り立ち、Valley of Fireの広大な赤褐色の砂岩や、ラスベガスを象徴する赤や黄色など、
様々な色の眩い光を放つクラシックなネオンサインを背景に、より洗練された一糸乱れぬパフォーマンスを見せる映像作品となっています！
また、一人一人の個性に合わせた衣装とシチュエーションで、様々な表情やパフォーマンスが堪能できる、見どころ満載のミュージックビデオです！

また、E-girlsの新たな真骨頂に成り得るピンヒールを履いたパフォーマンスも見どころのひとつ。
ラスベガスの煌々とする夜景に、本編とはガラリと変わった世界観の中、突如として現れる11人。
セクシー且つパワフルに、ピンヒールを履いて踊りこなすシンクロしたパフォーマンスは釘付けになる事間違い無し。

LETRA:

Bem na minha vez
De viver aquilo tudo que sonhei
E na hora que eu estava prestes a chegar
Na linha de chegada para conquistar

Bem na minha vez
Só Deus sabe quantas vezes eu busquei
Mas vi outra pessoa conquistar o que eu pedi
Aquilo que eu achava que era para mim

Perguntei para Deus
Por que o Senhor não quer me ouvir
Me frustei, eu chorei
Pensei até em desistir

Mas quando eu calo, ele me fala pra eu prosseguir
Se desanimo ele me diz: Filho estou aqui!
Vai chegar a sua vez
Não te esqueci
Pode confiar em mim

Aquilo que eu tenho preparado pra você
A sua imaginação não consegue prevê
Ore outra vez
Busque outra vez
Tente só mais uma vez

Não falhará
Deus cuidará 
Semeie os bons frutos e colherá. 
Vitória, glórias, vindas do céu 
Não manche as vestes, Ele é fiel.

A Rosa e o Beija-Flor
(Conde Macedo/ Jota Reis/ Neto Barros/ Cabeção Do Forró)

Quando você fica ao lado de uma pessoa
E ela mesmo em silêncio lhe faz bem
Quando você fecha os olhos
E o pensamento está
Fotografado o rosto desse alguém

Quando estiver no dia triste
Basta o sorriso dela pra você ficar feliz
Quando se sentir realizado
E dizer que encontrou o bem que você sempre quis

Quando chorar de saudades
Quando morrer de ciúmes
Quando sua sensibilidade identifica o perfume
Isso é amor, tá rolando amor
É o encontro de metades, a rosa e o beija-flor

""Anna come sono tante Anna permalosa
Anna bello sguardo, 
sguardo che ogni giorno perde qualcosa
Se chiude gli occhi lei lo sa
stella di periferia
Anna con le amiche
Anna che vorrebbe andar via

Marco grosse scarpe e poca carne
Marco cuore in allarme
con sua madre una sorella
poca vita sempre quella
Se chiude gli occhi lui lo sa
lupo di periferia
Marco col branco
Marco che vorrebbe andar via

E la luna è una palla
ed il cielo è un biliardo
quante stelle nei flipper
sono più di un miliardo

Marco dentro a un bar
non sa cosa farà
poi c'è qualcuno che trova una moto
si può andare in città

Anna bello sguardo non perde un ballo
Marco che a ballare sembra un cavallo
in un locale che è uno schifo
poca gente che li guarda
c'è una checca che fa il tifo

Ma dimmi tu dove sarà
dov'è la strada per le stelle
mentre ballano 
si guardano e si scambiano la pelle
e cominciano a volare
con tre salti sono fuori dal locale
con un aria da commedia americana
sta finendo anche questa settimana

Ma l'America è lontana
dall'altra parte della luna
che li guarda e anche se ride
a vederla mette quasi paura

E la luna in silenzio ora si avvicina
con un mucchio di stelle cade per strada
luna che cammina
luna di città
poi passa un cane che sente qualcosa
li guarda abbaia e se ne va

Anna avrebbe voluto morire
Marco voleva andarsene lontano
qualcuno li ha visti tornare

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

Ela chegou às quatro horas da matina
Logo que a manhã raiou lá na colina
Encantadora a donzela pequenina
Nasce uma estrela quando nasce uma menina

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

Já ele veio era de noite eu imagino
Chegou chorando como manda o figurino
Que a felicidade seja o seu destino
Beleza pura é nascimento de menino

Ela é a luz do Sol. Ele é o brilho da Lua 
Como o barco e o farol, gentileza gera ternura

Garota, garoto, espelho do outro, somos diferentes demais
Menino, menina, respeito e estima, nós temos direitos iguais

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

Mas que gigante! Esse menino é um colosso
Onde ele chega vai fazendo um alvoroço 
É travessura e gostosura esse moço 
Mamão papaia com açúcar sem caroço 

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

Ela é o rock´n roll misturado com bossa
O carnaval que vai fazendo aquela troça
Delicadeza da flor que nasceu na roça 
Tem a coragem da tigresa, a bela moça

Ela é a luz do Sol. Ele é o brilho da Lua 
Como o barco e o farol, gentileza gera ternura

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

Não tô valendo nada [Letra]

Logo hoje que eu sai com a minha namorada
Pra fazer uma média com ela na balada
Essa menina também resolveu sair de casa
Toda produzida a mais top da galáxia

Tá tirando onda rebolando na minha frente
De saia curtinha sorriso indecente
Ela é gostosa e só faz isso pra me provocar
Sabe que eu fico doido vendo ela dançar

Vou esperar minha mulher querer ir no banheiro
Aí eu ganho 5 minutinho de solteiro
É rapidinho ela nem vai desconfiar

Eu tinha que ter vindo pra balada com os parceiro
Aí não dava outra ia rolar não tinha jeito
E lá em casa a gente ia se acabar

Aaaai não tô valendo nada
Viiixe a minha carne é fraca
Nossa assim você acaba me matando

Weʻre excited to present our 2nd ʻSong Across Hawaiʻiʻ collaboration with Hawaiian nonprofit @Mana Maoli, filmed across many breathtaking Hawaii locations as part of their #ManaMele project, which features a Music & Multimedia Academy and Solar Mobile Studio with programs in more than a dozen schools.

Turn it up and let the music bring in the light! To learn more about this medley and Mana Mele, follow Mana Maoli on FB & IG, and visit manamele.org, where you can get a personal copy of this video for a donation of any amount. 




Playing For Change is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. Our primary focus is to record and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos we call Songs Around The World. Creating these videos motivated us to form the Playing For Change Band—a tangible, traveling representation of our mission, featuring musicians met along our journey, and establish the Playing For Change Foundation—a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world. Through these efforts, we aim to create hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.

Sorte Que Cê Beija Bem [ Letra ]
Composição: Gustavo Martins / Guilherme Ferraz / Rafael Quadros / Sando Neto / Ray Antônio / Paulo Pires / Diego Ferrari / Everton Matos

Eu jurei não bater na sua porta
Olha eu batendo 
E quebrando outra promessa

Eu tentei não tocar mais no seu nome
Mas de cada três palavras 
Uma me interessa

Você é um problema que eu quero ter
Mesmo sabendo que eu não consigo resolver
Eu prometo que não vou te amar
Porque essa promessa eu vou fazer questão de quebrar

Sabe o que você tem
Tem sorte que “cê” beija bem
Você é a corda bamba que eu aprendi a andar 

Sabe o que você tem
Tem sorte que “cê” beija bem
Só me deixar ir 
Porque sabe que eu vou voltar

Caía a tarde feito um viaduto
E um bêbado trajando luto
Me lembrou Carlitos
A lua, tal qual a dona do bordel,
Pedia a cada estrela fria
Um brilho de aluguel
E nuvens, lá no mata-borrão do céu,
Chupavam manchas torturadas, que sufoco!
Louco, o bêbado com chapéu-coco
Fazia irreverências mil pra noite do Brasil.
Meu Brasil
Que sonha com a volta do irmão do Henfil.
Com tanta gente que partiu num rabo de foguete.
Chora a nossa pátria mãe gentil,
Choram Marias e Clarisses no solo do Brasil.
Mas sei que uma dor assim pungente
Não há de ser inutilmente, a esperança
Dança na corda bamba de sombrinha

Rush F is a testament to the will-power of humanity to pay respects on a large scale. This playable version of Rush F will have your fingers tied in knots, but will ultimately be rewarding and great fun!

The sheet music for Rush F is intended for advanced level pianists, but we think that the hard work will really pay off for this one! Good luck!

Versuri :

Intro :
Ca ea, rece e doar ploaia
La inima-mi opreste bataia

Strofa 1:

Era un bagabond cu multe cicatrici
Canta langa greieri la lumini de licurici
Visator, fara bani, dar fericit mereu
Atat de fericit, zambea si cand dadea de greu,
Dar filmul i se rupe, e distras de doua cupe
Ce par sa il derute, ca-i par nemaivazute
Ochii ii raman blocati cateva minute
Isi ia inima-n dinti si merge s-o salute.
Si buzele ei raspund, in sufletul lui erup vulcanii
Se pare ca l-a lovit iubirea ca valul unui Tsunami
Si-o-ntreaba retinut, modest si rusinat
“Nu vrei sa te conduc acasa, ca s-a cam inserat?”
Avea un gol in stomac cand statea langa ea,
Avea emotii nu stia ce sa zica si nu prea vorbea.
Parfumul ei l-a ametit si-o-ntreaba cu greu
“Pot sa vin sa te iau maine de la liceu?”

Refren:

Ca ea, rece e doar plaoia
La inima-mi opreste bataia
Si m-a facut sa cred ca toate sunt ca ea
Ca ea, rece e doar plaoia
La inima-mi opreste bataia
Ea iubea doar banii, nu dragostea mea

Strofa 2:

S-a sunat de iesire, el sta nerabdator
Sa-si vada dragostea in fata ochilor,
Si-a pregatit discursul s-o scoata in oras
A luat tricoul cel mai bun de pe umeras.
Ca stie un restaurant bun si vrea sa-i propuna
Dac-ar vrea si i-ar placea sa ia masa-mpreuna
Bani nu prea avea la el, la doi sa se inhame
Asa c-o sa-i ia doar ei, el zice ca nu-i e foame.
E mai mult ca sigur ca-i o idealista
Nu-i ca toate tarfele materialista
Ca va pune pret pe suflet si nu se uita-n cont
Si ca pentru ea a renuntat la viata de bagabont
Deodata o vede, uite-o cum iese din liceu
Nici macar nu il saluta si se urca-ntr-un BMW-u'
Pleaca-n tromba, lasa fum in urma
O lacrima ii scapa ... si ura-n el se-aduna

Refren:

Ca ea, rece e doar ploaia
La inima-mi opreste bataia
Si m-a facut sa cred ca toate sunt ca ea
Ca ea, rece e doar plaoia
La inima-mi opreste bataia
Ea iubea doar banii, nu dragostea mea

Bridge:
Ca ea, e doar ploaia
Ca ea, rece e doar ploaia

Strofa 3:
Nu l-a vazut plangand, sau nevindecat
Nu l-a vazut la pamant, ca s-a ridicat
Pentru ca plange doar atunci cand tuna si ploua,
Sa nu-i vada lumea lacrimile cum se rup in doua
S-a jurat si s-a certat cu inima, i-a interzis
Sa mai bata pentru cineva vreodata nepermis
Am scris asta cu durere si-am scris-o cu greu

For more guitar lessons, see my other free tutorials.  For original and cover music by me, Erich, go to http://www.myspace.com/erichandreas .

Other videos cover beginner, advanced and intermediate levels.  I teach rock, blues, country and just about any other style on electric or acoustic.

Refren:

Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Cateodata mai gresesc
Ca nu-i usor
Din toate una am ales
Sa am suflet de om
Da’ oamenii mai si gresesc

Strofa 1:

Am ales sa fiu o voce , nu doar un ecou
Am ales sa fiu acelasi om de sub tricou
Am ales sa mor in arta, nu ingropat in aur
Am ales sa am onoare, 9 mai sange de taur
Am ales sa fiu ciocan sa bat la cap cuie
Am ales sa am cheia ce sufletu-l descuie
Am ales cu inima ce nu mi-o pierd prin dresuri
Am ales sa fiu medicament sa vindec prin versuri
N-am ales ales mai multe fete ca-mi ajunge una
N-am ales sa fug de trasnet cand plange furtuna
N-am ales calea usoara , drumul  fara spini
N-am ales gradina aia mare cu nuferi si crini
Am ales in viata statutul de revolver
Ca n-am vrut sa fiu glontul ce il ghideaza el
Am ales sa nu ma mint atunci cand dau de bine
Sa-mi fac zilnic cadoul de a fi sincer cu mine

Intamplator

Strofa 2:

Am ales sa nu port ura, ca ura naste ura
Am ales sa fiu atent la tot ce scot pe gura
Am ales sa ma trezesc in timp ce altii dorm
Am ales sa iubesc muzica cu nopti de nesomn
Am ales sa nu ma vad mai mult decat sunt
Am ales o viata simpla cu pret pe cuvant
Am ales sa-ncerc sa fiu exemplu separat de turma
C-atunci cand voi pleca d-aici sa las ceva in urma
N-am ales foarte atent acele persoane
Ce-au plecat de langa mine cand eram in foame
Am ales sa zbor printre parasute gol
Dar a mea nu s-a deschis si m-am lovit de sol
Am ales gresit odata tot de frica fricii
Si-am sfarsit convins ca-i bine sa am si vicii
Am ales tot ce-am ales sa simt ca traiesc
Si viata m-a invatat  de care sa ma feresc

F.Charm – Cod rosu

Versuri:

Refren:
Ti-am dat si sufletul meu
Dac-ai stii cat mi-e de greu
Va fi cod rosu de lacrimi
Am ochii plini de amintiri 
Ma-nec in dezamagiri
Va fi cod rosu de lacrimi

Strofa:
Mi-am pus sufletul pe tava
Ca mai apoi sa privesc in el ca-ntr-o epava
Am fost prins in farmece
Parca totu-i blestemat cu vraji si descantece
Si uite cum iti caut vina
C-atunci cand deschid ochii mi-esti fixata pe retina
Si-mi simt inima grea, cod rosu pe fata mea
Cand lacrimile curg, imi inunda linistea

Pre-refren:
Si nu pot face fata
Prin lacrimi vad in ceata
Si nu pot face fata
Mi-e atat de greu
Nu pot sa stau in casa
Amintirile m-apasa
Te-as vrea pentr-o secunda
In locul meu

Refren

{Cod rosu de lacrimi} (x2)

Strofa:
Recunosc ca am defecte fara rea intentie
Eu plecat, tu vroiai un strop de atentie
Cand zambeai mi se parea cat se poate de normal
Dar o faceai ca sa ascunzi, suvoi de lacrimi, infernal
E cod rosu
Acum plang in locul tau
As da timpul inapoi sa repar tot ce-a fost rau
Am sa-ti las ca testament aceasta tragica nuvela
E cod rosu de lacrimi, n-am nevoie de umbrela

Pre-refren

Refren

Bridge:
Si cand seara se lasa
Merg cu teama acasa
Unde-i un suflet lipsa
Si-n dormitor eclipsa
Si cand seara se lasa
Merg cu teama acasa
M-asteapta lacrimi si suspine
Ca locul tau in viata mea n-o sa-l ocupe nimeni

Refren

F.Charm - MAMA feat. Elena Gheorghe [Videoclip oficial]

Versuri:

Refren - Elena:

Mama inca nu ti-am spus,
Ca nimic nu-i mai presus,
Decat insemni tu pentru mine,
Ma cuprinde teama!
Teama c-ai sa pleci, pe meleaguri gri si reci
De langa mine

Strofa I - F.Charm:

Cei mai sinceri ochi si-o fata prea blanda
Palmele ridate, batute de-atata munca
Nu ti-am spus-o mama, dar in inima ta stii
Esti cel mai bun exemplu cand voi avea copii
Prea multi oameni au batut la usa sufletului meu
Dar numai mama a ramas atunci cand mi-a fost mai greu
Am vazut barbati, femei, ce se mananca-ntre ei
Vocea ta imi repeta: mama tu nu fi ca ei!

Pre-refren I - F.Charm:

Nu-i deloc usor,
Mi-e frica de gandul c-odata tu nu vei mai fi!
Anii trec in zbor,
O viata n-ajunge-i prea scurta sa-ti pot multumi!

Pre-refren II - F.Charm & Elena:

Si se-ntreaba ce-o mai fi cu mine,
N-am sunat-o de cateva zile,
Nu-ti fa griji inca sunt bine,
Am sa ma intorc acasa si-o sa fii mandra de mine mama!

Refren

Bridge - Elena:

Mama!
Esti un magic tablou,
Un cuvant cu ecou,
Cel mai mare cadou,
Te port in sufletul meu!

Strofa II - F.Charm:

Trec si saptamani cand uit sa sun,
Grijile pe primul loc le pun
Dar ai o inima atat de mare
Si ma-ntelegi fara suparare
Dar cand bat la usa casei tale,
Imi deschizi , pe fata ta e soare,
Imi pui tot ce ai mai bun pe masa,
Copilul tau e din nou acasa.

[Intro]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
Woop woop woop woop woop woop woop

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
I never meant to leave you hurting
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (it solo, solo, everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (it solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
Been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music without you (it solo, solo, everybody)
Ah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with someone new (it solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on

0,strav 0,185,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Murray (Moshe) Perahia was born in the Bronx borough of New York City to a family of Sephardi Jewish origin. According to the biography on his Mozart piano sonatas CD, his first language was Ladino. The family came from Thessaloniki. His father moved to the United States in 1935; many family members perished in the Holocaust a few years later.
Perahia began studying the piano at age four with a teacher he says was ""very limiting"" because she made him play a single piece until it was perfect. He says his musical interests blossomed at age fifteen for reasons he can't explain, and he began to practice seriously. At seventeen, Perahia attended Mannes College, where he studied keyboard, conducting, and composition with his teacher and mentor Mieczysław Horszowski. During the summer, he also attended Marlboro, where he studied with musicians Rudolf Serkin, Alexander Schneider, and Pablo Casals, among others. He played duets for piano four hands with Serkin, who later made Perahia his assistant at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, a position he held for over a year.
In 1965 Perahia won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. In 1972, he was the first North American to win first prize at the Leeds Piano Competition, helping to cement its reputation for advancing the careers of young pianistic talent. Dr. Fanny Waterman recalls anecdotally (in Wendy Thompson's book Piano Competition: The Story of the Leeds) that Horszowski had phoned her prior to the competition, announcing that he would be the winner. Other American contestants had apparently withdrawn their applications upon hearing that Perahia would be competing.
Perahia resides in London.

]Music career

In 1973 he worked with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears at the Aldeburgh Festival, and with fellow pianist Radu Lupu. He was co-artistic director of the Festival from 1981 to 1989.
In the 1980s, Perahia was invited to work with Vladimir Horowitz, an admirer of his art. Perahia says this had a defining influence on his pianism. 
Perahia's first major recording project was the complete piano concertos by Mozart, conducted from the keyboard with the English Chamber Orchestra. In the 1980s, he also recorded all the Beethoven piano concertos, with Bernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.
[edit]Hand injury
In 1990, Perahia suffered a cut to his right thumb, which became septic. He took antibiotics for this condition, but they affected his health. In 1992, his career was threatened by a bone abnormality in his hand causing inflammation requiring several years away from the keyboard, and a series of operations. During that time, he says, he found solace through studying the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. After being given the all-clear, he produced in the late 1990s a series of award-winning recordings of Bach's keyboard works, most notably a cornerstone rendition of the Goldberg Variations.

0,Mister Sussex,355,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"You may already be familiar with this clip from the 1981 film 'Christiane F', but this version is a new extended edit (more Bowie, less drugged up teenagers) and has a new improved soundtrack in an attempt to make a more self contained, stand alone version.

In the film, this scene shows the main character of the film, Christiane, attending a 70's Bowie concert in Berlin with her friends.  In reality Bowie filmed his part on a set in New York in 1980 , miming to an edited version of 'Station to Station' from the 'Stage' album. (At the time,  he was appearing on Broadway in 'The Elephant Man' and couldn't fly to Berlin for filming).  

In the movie, the performance footage then was edited with crowd scenes from an AC/DC stadium concert. The scene was intercut with plot elements consisting of teenagers smoking drugs and popping pills. One of the teenagers is then shown having a bad time of it sitting with his head in his hands with a contorted face. 

All of this is fine in the context of the film. But I wanted to remove these distracting plot elements and make a video which would serve as a stand alone performance video as much as possible. To this end, I've re-edited the video to replace the drug taking scenes with more Bowie performance shots. (I've also removed a brief wide shot of AC/DC on stage which was in the original edit).

The soundtrack of the film version overdubs the song with a lot of newly added crowd noise. Again, fine for the film, but it sounds excessive when viewed as a stand alone video. So I've replaced it with the 2005 remastered version of the song from 'Stage'.

In the film the song fades off into the next scene. Here I've extended it and given it an actual ending.

""From its first performance, Dvořák's 'American' Quartet has enjoyed lasting popularity for its tunefulness, its rhythmic verve, and its happy interplay of the four instruments. Given all the publicity afforded Dvořák's ideas on American music, one might reasonably ask just how 'American' Op. 96 really is. A theme in the third movement qualifies as having been borrowed from an American: 'a damned bird (red, only with black wings)' that kept singing where he was working. Dvořák worked the native bird's song into the scherzo (measures 21 and following). Beyond that we are on less firm ground. Many of the themes are entirely or nearly pentatonic, and some have wanted to see in this the influence of the black spiritual. But in fact Bohemian music is just as frequently pentatonic, and similar themes can be found in Dvořák's music long before he came to America. The opening of the work was based on Smetana's First Quartet, though Dvořák's mood is entirely different -- lighter and livelier throughout, with the poignant exception of the lyrical second movement, the plaintive melody of which -- echoed between violin and cello -- is a wonderful foil to the high spirits of the remaining three movements."" - Steven Ledbetter

Letra:

[Verso 1: Ana Mena, Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Amor, ya estoy conectada
Hoy quiero respirar tu voz hasta la madrugada
Imaginar que entre tú y yo no hay una pantalla (una pantalla, baby)
Que pida que erices mi piel con sólo rozarla
Ay, me muero de ganas
Y aunque te encuentres lejos
No he renunciado a la esperanza de conocernos
Y de olvidarme del celular y estar cuerpo a cuerpo (cuerpo a cuerpo, baby)
Dar rienda suelta a la locura y el deseo
De comerte a besos

[Coro: Ana Mena, Becky G]
Y ya es hora
Que negociemos ponerle fin a tanta demora
Que necesito quemar el fuego que me acalora
Y saciarme de ti, y tocar el cielo, y vivir lo nuestro
Y ya es hora
Que terminemos con esta ansia que nos devora
Que necesito de tus caricias aquí y ahora (yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Y pongámosle fin a tanto anhelo, pa' vivir lo nuestro

[Post-Coro: Ana Mena]
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca
Hoy me marcho para allí que tengo ganas de ti
Dale, que te caigo en unas horas

[Verso 2: Ana Mena, De La Ghetto]
(Ana Mena)
Te mando un privado, chateas conmigo
Lo que daría por un vis a vis
Te huelo a distancia, no importa la hora
Yo sigo aquí esperándote en Madrid, yeah
DeLa
Yo también quiero verte
Muchas de ganas de tenerte
Hacerte muchas cosas en la cama diferente (tú sabe')
Sé que lo mismo sientes (dale)
Hoy es tu día de suerte (geezy)
Por eso voy a hacer que sólo en mí tú siempre pienses
Es hora, baby, que salgamos del deseo ya
Dejemo' el juego y lleguemos a la intimidad
Que [?] pa' acabar tu necesidad
Dime dónde voy a llegar, baby

[Puente: Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Puede que sea una locura
Pero este amor va más allá de una simple aventura (aventura)
Y es que mi cuerpo pide más que otra foto tuya (foto tuya, baby)
Quiero una noche de pasión que alivie esta tortura
Y acabe con mis dudas

[Coro: Ana Mena, Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Y ya es hora
Que negociemos ponerle fin a tanta demora
Que necesito quemar el fuego que me acalora
Y saciarme de ti, y tocar el cielo, y vivir lo nuestro
Y ya es hora
Que terminemos con esta ansia que nos devora
Que necesito de tus caricias aquí y ahora (oh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Y pongámosle fin a tanto anhelo, pa' vivir lo nuestro
De La Ghetto, De La Geezy

[Post-Coro: Ana Mena, & Becky G, De La Ghetto]
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca
Hoy me marcho para allí
Que tengo ganas de tí
Dale que te caigo en unas horas (baby, ok)
Todos mis sentidos se alborotan (Becky G)
Quiero derretirme despacito en tu boca (De La Geezy baby)
Hoy me marcho para allí (Dabruk)
Que tengo ganas de tí (Ana Mena)
Dale que te caigo en unas horas (ya es hora)

Baby, tú tiene' marido y yo me enredé en tu piel (uah)

Baby, tú tienes tu novia y yo me enredé en tu piel
Y tú te enamoraste de mí, baby, yo ya lo sé
Que ella te falló, pero tú le fallaste también

[Verso 1: Anuel AA]
Tú ere' infiel, eh
Te gusta ganar, no te gusta perder (perder)
Y lo' marido' son bueno' amante cuando están traicionando su mujer (mujer)
Y la' traicione' te marcan, y nunca te olvidan (uah)
Y te cambian la vida
Y si no te fallan en la entrada, te fallan en la salida
Y no te cambian por algo mejor, te cambian por algo más rico
Bebesita, bonita, blanquita, bien rica como Lynette Chico
Tocándote, y mordiéndote to'a y rompiéndote
Ahogándote, apretándote to'a, estrujándote, uah
[Anuel AA, Karol G]

[Verso 2: Karol G]
Él sólo me cobra en mi parte
Nos dieron ganas de irnos pa' la calle, eh (uh)
Y salí con él pa' olvidarte
Y para recordar lo que es un buen amante, uh
Siempre que no' vemos
No' reímos, de hablando la pasamos bueno
Siempre que lo hacemo'
No podemo' evitar las gana' que tenemo'
Él y yo nos queremo'
Pero claro está que en el amor no creemos
Ay, qué rico como él y yo nos damos
Ahora me llama
Diciendo que me extraña en su cama
Pero pa' mí no existes, bebé, te olvidé
Quieres prometerme, pero ya lo sé, uoh
Que el que falla una vez, te falla dos y tres
[Puente: Anuel AA, Karol G]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-eh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-eh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no te cambian por algo mejor
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,1832,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Symphony No. 25 in G minor, K. 183/173dB, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in October 1773, shortly after the success of his opera seria Lucio Silla. It was supposedly completed October 5, a mere two days after the completion of his Symphony No. 24, although this remains unsubstantiated. Its first movement is widely known as the opening music in Miloš Forman's film Amadeus. The symphony is laid out in standard classical form:
1. Allegro con brio, 4/4 in G minor
2. Andante, 2/4 in E-flat major
3. Menuetto & Trio, 3/4 in G minor, Trio in G major
4. Allegro, 4/4 in G minor.
With its wide-leap melodic lines and brisk musical subjects, this symphony is characteristic of the Sturm und Drang style. It shares certain features with other Sturm und Drang symphonies of this time, and is likely inspired from Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 39 which is likewise in G minor. The opening Mannheim rocket (a rising arpeggiated sequence) was quoted by Beethoven in his first Piano Sonata as the principal subject of the first movement.

A visit to Italy has had a stimulating effect on many a composer. Johannes Brahms (1833-- 1897) was no exception when, on returning home in 1890, he set to work on his second String Quintet, Op. 111. In the finale, particularly, he let himself be carried away in cheerful Hungarian mood.

His contemporaries failed to recognise the Mediterranean open-mindedness and extroversion of the melodic work, and one of Brahms's champions, Eduard Hanslick, even detected signs of introspection. ""Brahms appears increasingly to withdraw into himself, seems more at ease, with ever-greater assurance in the vigorous expression of simple feelings. This work is endowed with intense emotional life, without effort, without excess, without artifice!""",26,1724,0,0,922,2013-05-04 13:28:20,0,"Vilde Frang, Elina Vähälä, Elina Vahala, Vladimir Bukac, yuval gotlibovich, Jian Wang, String Quintet, Brahms, springlightmusic, Johannes Brahms (Composer), Classical, cello, Violin, Plays","Johannes Brahms: String Quintet No. 2 in G Major, Op. 111",Ye2pDTJNm6U,182567,CKwCEAA,g,0,13,5,4,124,5,5.26142227915067,2.0569048513364727,2.964730921053629,1.414973347970818,5,18,0.14074074074074072,130,0.0,13,0.0625,10,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,3,1,0,0,1,5,3,1,0,3,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,57,0.5634846936353897,0.3909408411271848,2.0952556635114608,1,0,1.0

Hai tay anh ôm xương rồng rất đau 
Đôi vai anh mang nỗi buồn rất lâu 
Chân anh lang thang kiếm em ở khắp chốn

Đôi khi cô đơn giết anh từng cơn, em hỡi

Anh ngỡ lại để ôm một mình nhớ thương 
Ngày không em lòng anh thừa đông, giá băng theo chiều tan màu mưa, 
Một lần xa vòng tay của em là bao bão lòng 
Nhìn vào mắt của em giờ đây, khoé mi anh lệ tuôn thầm cay. 
Anh rất buồn, nhưng không biết phải làm sao ?

Verse 1
It’s late at night I go to bed
But I can’t get no rest
My boyfriend quit I’m almost dead
I’ll have to do my best! 
I’m up and down I feel so fat
I ain’t got no more fizz
Don’t even get to keep the cat
But that’s just how it is! 

Chorus 1
I Sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah dah! 
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap Bah da de da dah dah! 

Verse 2
I get up late I stub my toe
I’ve got a few missed calls
I lost my job I didn’t know
And that’s not good at all! 
I get my bag I go outside
Just minding my own biz
I go to pay but my card has been denied
But that’s just how it is! 

Chorus 2
I Sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah dah! 
And everybody sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap Bah da de da dah dah

Verse 3
Another week the same old shit
My troubles getting worse
And then I get a bigger hit
Cos someone stole my purse! 
I met a guy he knows my name
He also told me his
And if we want to have some fun 
Well that’s just how it is

Chorus 3

Ha ha ha ha ha

It's all about the game, and how you play it
All about control, and if you can take it
All about your debt, and if you can pay it
It's all about pain, and who's gonna make it...

I am the game, you don't wanna play me
I am control, no way you can change me
I am have heavy debts, no way you can pay me
I am the pain, and I know you can't take me

Look over your shoulder, ready to run
Like a good little bitch, from a smoking gun
I am the game, and I make the rules
So move on out, and you can die like a fool
Try and figure out what the move's gonna be
Come on over sucker, why don't you ask me?
Don't you forget there's a price you can pay
'Cuz I am the game and I want to play

It's time to play the game...
Ha ha ha ha

I am control, there's no way you can change me
I am your debts, and know you can't pay me
I am your pain, and I know you can't take me

You're gonna change your name, you're gonna die in flames

""Salam Alaikum"" Lyrics:

You can try and turn off the sun
I’m still going to shine away, yeah
And tell everyone
We’re having some fun today
We can go wherever you want to
And do whatever you like
Let’s just have a real good time

CHORUS:
Assalamu Alaikum, Alaikum yeah!
(Peace be upon you)

I just want to spread love and peace
And all of my happiness, yeah
To everyone I that meet
‘Cause I'm feeling spectacular
I love it when we love one another
Give thanks everyday
For this life, living with a smile on our face

CHORUS

Spread peace on the earth
Cherish the love that is around us
Spread peace on the earth
Treasure the love, let it surround us
Always be kind, always remind one another
Peace on the earth everyday

CHORUS

Assalamu Alaikum, hey!

""I Promise"" Lyrics:

I promise anytime you call me
It don't matter where I am
I'll always be there, like you've been there
If you need me closer, I'll be right over
I swear, I swear

Every time that I need you by my side  
Every time I lose my way in life
You're my circle of life, compass and guide
There behind me
And one day when the tables finally turn
And it’s me you’re depending on
I’ll put you first, hold you close
Like you taught me
Know that I'll be there for you, for you

Chorus:
I promise anytime you call me
It don't matter where I am
I'll always be there, like you've been there
If you need me closer, I'll be right over
I swear, I swear
I promise anytime you call me
It don't matter where I am
I'll always care for you, go anywhere for you
If you need me closer, I'll be right over
I swear, ooh

There are days when I just don't want to talk
And your feelings hit a wall
But that won’t change
The love you’ve raised inside this family
Everything that I do is to make you proud
I just want to say it, and say it loud
You're my heat when I'm cold
The place I call home, and always will be
Know that I'll be there for you, for you

CHORUS

Having someone to go to
Having someone to love
Having both is a blessing
That was sent from above
Oh I know that wherever I'll go
You'll be forever in my heart

CHORUS

J.Sheon -Don't Ask (Official Music Video)
內附CC字幕

J.Sheon演技大爆發
麻煩還是請大家務必要看到最後！別問，很可怕啦！

歌迷期待度破表，橫掃各大串流平台排行榜成績高居不下的『別問很可怕』是一首經典三拍節奏藍調情歌。有的時候，當一個睜眼的瞎子是快樂的；有些事情越挖越痛，如果秘密跟臭水溝一樣越挖越臭那不如眼不見為淨。

此次的MV拍攝，特別邀請和J.Sheon長期攜手創作、最有默契的謝乾乾來執導。在J.Sheon尚未發片以前，不少的影像作品都是出自於謝乾乾之手，兩人的默契可說是不在話下。為了呈現MV裡黑色深情的詭譎氛圍，J.Sheon吃盡不少苦頭，導演特別選在夜晚的陽明山深山裡取景拍攝，在悶熱的天氣裡，J.Sheon不僅遭受大量的黑蚊襲擊，更要臨危不亂的配合劇情要求，在大量的深情與冷血的精神分裂劇情中，激發出J.Sheon內心深處的演技魂。 
 
『別問很可怕』這首歌是J.Sheon透過周遭好友在感情上的故事寫成一個雖綠光發亮卻又輕描淡寫的情歌，所以別用悲傷的角度去看待這總有一天會發生在你我身上的瞎事，試著放下它，接受它，然後看不見它。瞎彌陀佛。

每天都想可以快點見到她拉她的手
知道她也是猜是她的未接來電來了好幾通

正當我想著baby 希望她馬上就來
意外發現她的手機沒帶
太意外

總以為她會永遠陪我一步一步慢慢走
總以為無聊當有趣的幽默只有她能懂
我不是她的菜 早該把手鬆開
噢 太意外

唉 為何妳的秘密不刪
唉 現在已經麻痺無感
到底是怎樣 別問很可怕
Oh girl太意外

唉 為何妳的幽默跟浪漫
要跟我以外的人分享
到底是怎樣 別問很可怕
Oh girl 

站著看著貓咪睡在我們中間的枕頭
才剛剛上網訂了一年份的飼料哪能走
我坐著呆滯想著“希望一切能重來”
愛情真的變得像是公害
噢 太意外

總以為她會永遠陪我一步一步慢慢走
總以為無聊當有趣的幽默只有她能懂
我不是她的菜 早該把手鬆開
Oh girl

裝忙想找藉口忘記
什麼 愛妳想妳我是全都當屁
煩到腦袋都快要當機
哎唷 真是哎唷呀 哎唷呀

""Rasool'Allah"" Lyrics:-

Oh, you came into this life
Brought up as an orphan child
Through a time of deep despair, O Muhammad!
Your days at work began
As a fair and honest man
You showed just how much you cared
And one night in that cave
When the Archangel came
And your life in this world
Would never be the same

Chorus:
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
(O Messenger of Allah, O beloved of Allah)
Your light is always showing me the way
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I’m longing for the day I see your face
You brighten up my day
And in my heart you’ll stay
With every breath I take
I’ll never leave your way

Eyes that could light up any soul
You became the Chosen One
To proclaim the word of God, O Muhammad!
In the brightness of the sun
Or the stillness of the night
You would never ever stop
Being kind, giving hope
And serenity and love
To a divided world
That didn't have enough

CHORUS

Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
(O Messenger of Allah, O beloved of Allah)
Peace be upon you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I really love you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Peace be upon you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah

CHORUS

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Alex Cameron]
I've lived in lonely cities
I've crossed deserts on camel back
And I've filled the halls of folklore with things I'd rather we forget
I could sweep you off the street so saying this is goddamn tough
But this town might be big enough...

[Verse 2: Kirin J Callinan]
See, I reckon what you're saying
But this dog's run every course
I've roam without my boots on
I've raced without my horse
And then I ate my horse's meat straight from my horse's bones
'Cause this dog
Must roam alone

[Verse 3: Alex Cameron & Kirin J Callinan]
You could shoot me in the mountains
In the cold fat rain
We could do it in the countryside
As we walk the plain
It wouldn't give us any closure
All cowboys need to trust
That this town might be big enough
For both of us

[Chorus: Jimmy Barnes]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

[Verse 4: Kirin J Callinan & Alex Cameron]
Well, I'd be a doggamn liar
If I said this ain't a lonely town
And what I wouldn't give
To have a friend around
We could trade in all our silver bullets
And buy a patch of dust
This town might just be big enough
For all of us

[Chorus: Jimmy Barnes]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

[Outro: Alex Cameron & Kirin J. Callinan]
Everybody!
This town!
This world!
Are you big enough?
From Australia to America
And Russia and China
All of Asia
Let me out
Europe and Great Britain
Oh Canada
In Croatia and Serbia
Kenya get it India
It's serious in Syria
Believe in us Bolivia
We're Ghana be big enough
For Africa, South Africa
South Korea, North Korea
Algeria, Nigeria
Antarctica, Around the Equator
Cuba, Indonesia
Jamaica, we'll take ya
To Florida and catch you later
I'll catch you later

Let me out

Lyrics:

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, Totally Krossed Out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

[Hook 2: Miguel & J. Cole]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche?
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

1,J Balvin,3696,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"Produced by YouTube, J Balvin: Redefining Mainstream is a look inside the life of José Álvaro Osorio Balvin. This film is a portrait of his life from a more personal perspective than we have seen before. From his early days freestyling in the streets and barbershops of Medellín, Colombia, to sold out arena shows across the globe.

(J Balvin, men, leggo, come on)
Escucha como digo tu nombre
Desde Medellín hasta Londres
Cuando te llamo, la maldad responde
No pregunta cuándo, sólo dónde
Te dejas llevar, de lo prohibido eres adicta
Una adicción que sabes controlar
Y te dejas llevar, lo más caliente en la pista
Todo lo que tienes de muestra, ¿pa' qué lo dan?
Mordiendo mis labios verás
Que nadie más está en mi camino
Nada tiene por qué importar
Déjalo atrás, estás conmigo

我以為要是唱得用心良苦　你總會對我多點在乎
我以為雖然愛情已成往事　千言萬語說出來可以互相安撫

期待你感動　真實的我們難相處　寫詞的讓我　唱出你要的幸福
誰曾經感動　分手的關頭才懂得　離開排行榜　更銘心刻骨

我已經相信　有些人我永遠不必等
所以我明白　在燈火闌珊處　為什麼會哭
你不會相信　嫁給我明天有多幸福
只想你明白　我心甘情願　愛愛愛愛到要吐

那是醉生夢死　才能熬成的苦
愛如潮水　我忘了我是誰　至少還有你哭

我想唱一首歌為我們祝福　唱完了我會一個人住

我願意試著瞭解從此以後　擁擠的房間一個人的心有多孤獨

我已經相信　有些人我永遠不必等
所以我明白　在燈火闌珊處　為什麼會哭
你不會相信　嫁給我明天有多幸福
只想你明白　我心甘情願　愛愛愛愛到要吐

讓我斷了氣　鐵了心愛的過火　一回頭就找到出路
讓我成為了無情的Ｋ歌之王　麥克風都讓我征服
想不到你　若無其事的說　這樣濫情　何苦

我想來一個吻別　作為結束　想不到你只說我不許哭　不讓我領悟",304,232,0,1,8166,2013-01-07 03:55:37,0,"EEG, 英皇娛樂, OFFICIAL, 官方, 完整版, 下載音樂, 音樂下載, 音乐下载, mp3, HD, 首播, G.E.M 喜歡你, AMAZING chest control by Alexis Sánchez, 男人唔可以窮, 鄧小巧 我们都寂寞, 中國好聲音第3季, 周融, 反佔中, 林新強, 安德斯·埃格斯特朗, Robin Williams, 羅賓威廉斯, 昆凌, Isis, 伊波拉病毒, 等一個人咖啡, 超級月亮, 何傲兒, 房祖名藏毒, 馬賽赴英, 失戀急讓, 水蜜桃團購, 保濕, 超神奇奶油刀, 伊波拉方程式, 鴛鴦王, 楊謹華, 韓國美背小姐, 柯震東吸毒, 最後庇佑, 理財, 冰桶大挑戰, 伍家廉被炒, 譚曉彤, 家商妹貝果, 阿喜.黃金價.趙芸, 常抽筋, 小小瑜, 江角真紀子, 孫國豪拜陰廟, 小茉莉, 潘瑋柏, 張馨予, 嘴破洞A Hundred Times, 小日子, 月半小夜曲, 不再說分手, 咖啡在等一個人, 致少年時代, 一, 最後最後, 從今喜歡孤單一個, 八九十, 缺口, 等一個人, 錯過你, 食物鏈, 不如吃茶去弹指一挥间, 别让爱迷路, 何必怀念, 唤醒时空, 强迫症, 无情, 待我长发及腰, 飘洋过海来看你",陳奕迅 Eason Chan《K歌之王(國)》[Official MV],Iw3WgP8A18I,3071177,CDIQAA,k,0,13,1,7,7,0,6.4873048466964525,2.4361626470407556,3.912009375586978,2.482873583608754,6,2,0.4,9,0.6000000000000001,74,0.0,3,0,3,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,0.6030253653917776,0.375527696726219,1.575597485676671,0,0,1.0

LYRICS:
[Verse 1 – Julie Bergan]:
Fireflies
A million little pieces
Feeds the dying light
And breathes me back to life
 
In your eyes 
I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame
It brings the sweetest pain (your palms, the sweetest pain)

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x3]

[Verse 2 – Julie Bergan]:
So alive
Your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin
It turns me on again
 
You and I
Survivors of the same kind
And we’re the only ones
Dancing on the sun

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
You’re the demon in my mind             
Like a fever, feels so right
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x3]

[Bridge - Seungri]:
Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
We’re monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
Hear you calling for me
Hear you calling me on from afar

[Chorus – Julie Bergan]:
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
I feel the heat as we collide
Like a fever that feels so right
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite [x6]

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,341,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major, K. 219, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1775, premiering during the holiday season that year in Salzburg. It follows the typical fast-slow-fast musical structure. Mozart composed the majority of his concertos for string instruments from 1773 to 1779, but it is unknown for whom, or for what occasion, he wrote them. Similarly, the dating of these works is unclear. Analysis of the handwriting, papers and watermarks has proved that all five violin concertos were re-dated several times. The year of composition of the fifth concerto ""1775"" was scratched out and replaced by ""1780"", and later changed again to ""1775"". Mozart would not use the key of A major for a concerto again until the Piano Concerto K. 414. The autograph score is preserved in the Library of Congress, Washington D.C. The concerto is scored for two oboes, two horns and strings.
The movements are as follows:
1. Allegro Aperto - Adagio - Allegro Aperto
2. Adagio
and 3. Rondo - Tempo di Minuetto.
The aperto marking on the first movement is a rare marking in Mozart's instrumental music, but appears much more frequently in his operatic music. It implies that the piece should be played in a broader, more majestic way than might be indicated simply by allegro. The first movement opens with the orchestra playing the main theme, a typical Mozartian tune. The solo violin comes in with a short but sweet dolce adagio passage in A Major with a simple accompaniment in the orchestra. (This is the only instance in Mozart's concerto repertoire in which an adagio interlude of this sort occurs at the first soloist entry of the concerto.) It then transitions back to the main theme with the solo violin playing a different melody on top of the orchestra. The first movement is 10-11 minutes long.
The rondo finale's main theme is a typical Mozartean theme, but the contrasting sections feature loud passages of Turkish music that have caused some to call this the ""Turkish Concerto"".
Mozart later composed the Adagio for violin and orchestra, K. 261 as a substitute slow movement for this concerto.
The whole piece is about 28 minutes long.

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,893,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major (K. 488) is a musical composition for piano and orchestra written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was finished, according to Mozart's own catalogue, on March 2, 1786, around the time of the premiere of his opera, The Marriage of Figaro. It was one of three subscription concerts given that spring and was probably played by Mozart himself at one of these. The concerto is scored for piano solo and an orchestra consisting of one flute, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns and strings. In Mozart's later works the wind instruments are equal to the stringed instruments, and this is also the case in this concerto. It has three movements:
1. Allegro in A major and common time.
2. Adagio in F-sharp minor and 6/8 time (in later editions, the tempo is listed as Andante).
3. Allegro assai in A and alla breve (in later editions, the tempo is listed as Presto). In Rondo form.
The first movement is mostly sunny and positive with the occasional melancholic touches typical of Mozart pieces in A major and is in sonata form. The piece begins with a double exposition, the first played by the orchestra, and the second when the piano joins in. The first exposition is static from a tonal point of view and is quite concise, the third theme is not yet revealed. The second exposition includes the soloist and is modulatory. It is also includes the third previously unheard third theme. The second exposition is ornamented as opposed to the first exposition which is not. The second theme has harmonic tension. This is expressed by dissonances that are played on the beat, and then solved by an interval of a second going downwards. This is also expressed in the use of chromatics in the melody and bass lines which is a cause for harmonic tension, as the listeners anticipate the arrival of the tonic.
The second, slow movement, in ternary form, is melancholic and somewhat operatic in tone. The piano begins alone with a theme characterized by unusually wide leaps. This is the only movement by Mozart in F sharp minor. The dynamics are soft throughout most of the piece. The middle of the movement contains a brighter section in A major announced by flute and clarinet that Mozart would later use to introduce the trio ""Ah! taci ingiusto core!"" in his opera Don Giovanni. The third movement is a vigorous and cheerful rondo, shaded by moves into other keys as is the opening movement (to C major from E minor and back during the secondary theme in this case, for instance) and with a central section whose opening in F sharp minor is interrupted by a clarinet tune in D major, an intrusion that reminds us, notes Girdlestone, that instrumental music at the time was informed by opera buffa and its sudden changes of point of view as well as of scene.

► Any song on the poll is eligible for voting – you need to vote for at least 10 songs and you can only submit your choice once.

► Each song you choose in your vote receives 1 point towards the chart. The day before the chart is due out, the poll will be closed, and we will make the chart based on those results. 

► The songs that will be eligible each week must either:

1) Have been on the chart within the last few weeks.
2) Have been released since the last voting period closed.

► This means that if a song falls off, it has a few weeks to return, or else it cannot come back on the chart. 

► Songs can only remain on the chart for a maximum of 10 weeks. Songs that have been on the chart for 10 weeks will no longer be eligible for voting.

► If a song gains less than 200 votes on the poll, it will automatically be excluded from next week's voting. This is to keep the poll from being crowded with songs that have minimal chance of entering the chart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWARDS:

8 WEEK AWARD ► For songs that have been on the chart for a minimum of 8 weeks.

GOLD AWARD ► For Songs that Reached The Top 10. 

PLATINUM AWARD ► For Songs That Reached The Top 5, or Have Been In The Top 10 For 3 Weeks.

LYRICS : 
Behti Rehti
Nahar Nadiya Si
Teri Duniya Mein
Meri Duniya Hai
Teri Chaahaton Mein
Tu saath hai… ho din raat hai
Agar tum saath ho
Tu saath hai… din raat hai
Saaya saaya, maahi ve! maahi ve!
Meri har baat mein saath tu hai
Mahi Ve! Maahi Ve!
Mere saare haalaat tu
Yeh jeena bhi, na jeena bhi
Hai dono ka tumse hi vaasta
Main hi to hoon tera pataa
Hai doosra naa koi raasta
Tum Saath Ho Ya Na
Ho Kya Fark Hai
Bedard Thi Zindagi Bedard Hai
Tu saath hai…dinn raat hai
Agar tum saath ho
Tu saath hai… din raat hai
Saaya saaya, maahi ve! maahi ve!
Meri sab raaz, kal-aaj, tu hai
Mahi Ve! Maahi Ve!
Meri har udaan ek tu
Pal Bhar Thahar Jaao
Dil Ye Sambhal Jaaye
Kaise Tumhe Roka Karun
Meri Taraf Aata Har
Gham Phisal Jaaye
Aankhon Mein Tum Ko Bharun
Bin Bole Baatein Tumse Karun
‘Gar Tum Saath Ho
Tum saath ho

quando sopra il viso
c'è una ruga che non c'era

fai l'indifferente

sbattere la testa mille volte
contro il muro

del destino

di una vita immaginaria

Antonio Vivaldi's 12 violin concertos ""Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione"" Op.8 of the collection that contains The Four Seasons as 4 concertos. In preparing this recording Giuliano Carmignola and Andrea Marcon has worked not from the familiar published edition of 1725 in Amsterdam but largely from manuscripts preserved in libraries in Turin, Dresden and Manchester. 

The stylistic freedom (and technical difficulty) of these unpublished versions offer fascinating insights into Vivaldi's own working methods and reveal surprisingly differences to their printed counterparts.

In comparison with other extant versions, the Manchester Four Seasons display a freedom and spirit of harmonic experimentation which, for Carmignola and Marcon, provide the key to the works interpretation. 

The published Amsterdam version contains less madness than the original versions.

Lyrics:

When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly

I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

Lyrics:

 רבות עבר העם הזה בדרך
ואני הולך עם ראש למעלה
כל אחד הוא בן או בת של מלך
כך היה וככה זה גם הלאה
יהודי עם נשמה בוערת
בכל מקום, ובכל ארץ
לא רוצה שיהיה אחרת
יהודי אני
זה משהוא נצחי

בני אברהם יצחק ויעקוב
בני שרה רבקה רחל ולאה
{Translation - The children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the children of Sarah, Rivka, Rachel and Leah}

עברי אנכי ואת ה’ אלקי השמים אני ירא
(’יונה א’ ט)
{Translation - I am a Hebrew (a Jew) and the L-rd, G-d of the heavens [is The One] I fear. - Jonah, 1:9}

A little bit of history I’ve been through
Ask me where I’m from, and I will tell you
I’m a Jew and every Jew’s a proud Jew
Not just me, my sisters and my brothers
Never be ashamed to be a proud Jew
It’s not what you’ve done, it’s how He made you
So sing this song and spread the pride around you
Yehudi Ani, eternally!

בני שרה רבקה רחל ולאה

עברי אנכי ואת ה’ אלקי השמים אני ירא

I’m a Jew and I’m proud
And I’ll sing it out loud
‘Cuz forever and ever
That’s what I’ll be
I’m a Jew and I’m proud
And without a doubt
Hashem is always watching over me

I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you look at me

I know that I'm alive

When you bless the day

All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman 
On clouds above

I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
Cause I am alive
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you reach for me
Raising spirits high
God knows that,
That I'll be the one standing by
Through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life

When you call on me
When you reach for me
I get wings to fly
I feel that...

 또한, 타이틀곡 '울고 싶지 않아'는 세븐틴으로서는 본격적으로 처음 EDM을 시도한 곡으로 세븐틴이 그동안 보여준 소년의 순수한 감정을 유지하되, 보다 깊은 모습을 드러내며 깊은 감성을 보여주고자 노력한 곡이다. 또한, 서정적인 감성을 담고 있는 신디사이저와 격렬한 비트가 교차하면서 눈물이 흐를 것 같지만 울고 싶지 않은 세븐틴의 마음을 담아냈으며, 특히 슬픈 감성 사이로 듣는 사람의 귀를 사로잡는 비트가 매혹적인 곡이다.

แต่ละเรื่องราวที่เราได้เจอะได้เจอ  แต่ละความฝันที่เคยแบ่งปันกันมา 
แต่ละฤดูที่มันได้ผ่านและพ้นไป         ได้พิสูจน์ใจ 
     
จากที่คุ้นเคยเพียงการเดินอยู่ลำพัง  จากที่เคยฝันคนเดียวอยู่ไปวันวัน 
จากที่ไม่เคยมีใครมาอยู่ในหัวใจ  ก็มีเธอนั้น 
     
เพราะได้เจอกับเธอ ทุกวันมีความหมาย  ย้ำในหัวใจเรื่อยมา 
     
ดีใจที่มีวันนี้ ดีใจที่ได้พบเธอ     
ดีใจที่ชีวิตฉันมีเธอได้เรียนรู้     
และใช้เวลาอยู่ด้วยกัน     
ดีใจที่เป็นคนนี้ เป็นเธอคนที่แสนดี     
ในใจได้แต่เพียงหวังให้เป็นอยู่อย่างนี้     
และขอมีกันตลอดไป ฉันขอเธอได้หรือเปล่า     
     
อุ่นใจทุกทีที่เราได้อยู่ด้วยกัน   สุขใจทุกครั้งเมื่อคิดว่ายังมีเธอ 
เธอคือสายลมที่คอยพัดผ่านในหัวใจ ทุกเวลาเสมอ

Lyrics
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

Now I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I'll be watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

So, you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do

특히 ‘역대급 청량美’를 예고한 세븐틴의 타이틀곡 ‘어쩌나’는 누군가를 좋아하는 감정을 무엇으로도 형용할 수 없을 만큼 너무 좋아서 ‘어쩌나’라는 말 밖에 나오지 않는 벅찬 마음과 함께 풋풋한 감정을 담아낸 곡으로, 세븐틴만 이 표현해내는 예쁜 가사와 경쾌한 스윙 리듬과 얼반 소울을 기반으로 한 멜로디가 함께 녹아 들어 한층 세련되고 청량한 분위기를 자아내 음악 팬들의 두 귀를 단숨에 사로잡을 예정이다.

SEVENTEEN released a new album 'YOU MAKE MY DAY' after 5 months, and it presents the most wonderful moment of SEVENTEEN's youth.

Especially, their title song ""Oh My!"" with 'the most refreshing vibe ever' means shouting ""Oh My!"", because no other words can explain the feeling of liking someone. It, indeed, delivers full heart emotion of young love and definitely catches the attention of every listener with sophisticated and fresh ambiance from SEVENTEEN's unique lyrics and melody like cheerful swing rhythm and Urban soul.

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

i cant deny 
im paralysed from the inside 
every day i wake to feel the same 
 
and every time 
you ask me how im feeling 
i just smile and tell you that im fine 
 
i dont know why 
im terrified of everything 
just to call the doctor seems daunting 
 
for most of my life 
ive felt a sharp uncertainty 
now its just become a part of me 
 
i cant deny 
im paralysed from the inside 
every day i wake to feel the same 
 
and every time 
you ask me how im feeling 
i just smile and tell you that im fine 
 
its hard to stay true 
to myself and to you 
i cant measure up to  
this girl you thought you knew 
 
this aching in my heart 
is tearing me apart 
but darling all your love

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Martin Scorsese
Primary Production Location: New York City, New York

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Bad"" was the first of nine short films produced for recordings from Bad, one of the best selling albums of all time. The ""Bad"" single hit No. 1 in three countries in 1987, topping the charts in the United States, Spain and the Netherlands and reaching Top 5 in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. In the U.S., ""Bad"" was the second of five consecutive No. 1 singles from one album on the Billboard Hot 100-making Michael the first artist to achieve this milestone. 

Inspired by the real-life story of Edmund Perry, a prep school graduate from Harlem whose shooting death by a plainclothes policeman galvanized New York City, ""Bad"" stars Michael as Darryl, a student returning to his inner-city home while on break from a prestigious academy. In the short film's extended black and white sequence, Darryl comes into conflict with his neighborhood friends (led by actor Wesley Snipes in a breakthrough role) after showing discomfort over their attempts at petty crime. Angrily dismissed by his friends for no longer being ""bad,"" Darryl challenges them in an abandoned subway station. As the film suddenly transitions to color, Darryl, clad in the black leather outfit Michael wears on the Bad album sleeve, leads a troupe of dancers in a high energy performance of ""Bad,"" asserting his toughness without resorting to violence and ultimately earning the respect of his peers.

Baksztagiem pruł nasz ""I'm Alone"", hen, od Meksyku bram,
A Jankes, w dziób kopany, po piętach deptał nam.
Tysiące beczek rumu od lockerów aż po dno,
I nawet kabla luzu, choćbyś robił nie wiem co.

    Ref.
   Sam Neptun śpiewał szanty, po cichu sprzyjał nam,
   Więc bił rekordy ""I'm Alone"", choć groził wciąż Wuj Sam.
   Na jedną kartę wszystko, jak struna każdy bras,
   ""Niech diabli porwą Coast Guard"" - tak mawiał każdy z nas.

A dawniej szkuner ""I'm Alone"", hen, po łowiskach gnał,
Lecz w końcu ryb zabrakło i głód w oczy zajrzał nam.
Za burtę poszły sieci, bo tak krzyczał kobiet tłum,
Jankesi mają ginu dość, postawmy więc na rum.

   Ref...

Gdy stawialiśmy żagle, to Coast Guard wpadał w trans,
Ta banda bubków w baliach nie miała żadnych szans.
Pułapkę zastawili gnoje, choć tak dobrze szło,
Posłali dzielny ""I'm Alone"" z ładunkiem aż na dno.

   Ref...

Niejeden w Nowej Szkocji szkuner taki spotkał los,
A wszystko przez cholerny głód i wiecznie pusty trzos.
Choć jeden z nich - nasz ""I'm Alone"" - swe miejsce w pieśni ma
I pewnie Neptun lubi go, i w kości na nim gra.

   Ref.
   I nawet śpiewa szanty, po cichu sprzyja nam,
   Choć leży na dnie ""I'm Alone"" i śmieje się Wuj Sam.
   Na jedną kartę wszystko, jak struna każdy bras,
   ""Niech diabli porwą Coast Guard"" - tak mawiał każdy z nas.

A ci co pokład ""I'm Alone"" kochali jak swój dom,
Nie dla nich blaski sławy i nie dla nich w niebie tron.
Niech mają choć ten cichy klang, ten jeden marny dzwon,
Niech każdy do nich woła: ""Hej, smugglers z ""I'm Alone""!""

   Ref.
   Niech Neptun śpiewa szanty, po cichu sprzyja nam,
   Rekordy bije ""I'm Alone"" i zamknie się Wuj Sam.

Boney M is a truly unforgettable name in the history of music. This glamorous and extremely likeable group came together in 1976 and ever since then occupied a special place in the hearts of music lovers the world over. Frank Farian, Liz Mitchell, Maizie Williams, Marcia Barrett, Bobby Farrell (and Reggie Tsiboe from 1982 to 1990) formed Boney M.
Though Boney M made modest beginnings, they soon turned into a major hit with their music which was catchy, lively and very rhythmic. Boney M's music has influences of Reggae, Funk, Rock, Gospel and Disco.
Their songs had distinctive soul soothing melodies and foot tapping beats and this is probably the reason why Boney M's songs were played non stop at all the discos around the world.
Boney M. - the most successful pop music export in the history of Germany. To date, worldwide sold 160 million copies of their albums and singles.

Rag'n'Bone Man - Skin (Lyrics)

When I heard that sound
When the walls came 
Down I was thinking about you
About you

When my skin grows old
When my breaths runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

Seconds from my heart
A bullet from the dark
Helpless I surrender
Shackled by your love

Holding me like this
Poison on your lips
Only when it's over
The silence hits so hard

'cause it was almost love
It was almost love
It was almost love
It was almost love

When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you

When my skin grows old
When my breaths runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

When I run out of breath to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you
About you

It was almost love
It was almost 
We bleed ourselves in vein
How tragic is this game
Turn around, I'm holding on to someone
But the love is gone

Carrying the load
With wings that feel like stone
Knowing that we nearly fell so far 
Now it's hard to tell

Yeah we came so close
It was almost love
It was almost love
It was almost love

When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you

When my skin grows old
When my breaths runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

When I run out of breathe to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you
About you

I reached out for your hand
When the walls were caving in
But I see you on the other side
We can try 
All over again

When I heard that sound
When the walls came down
I was thinking about you
About you

When my skin grows old
When my breaths runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

When I run out of breathe to breathe
It's your ghost I see
I'll be thinking about you
About you

Because it was almost love
It was almost love
It was almost love

Refren x 2
Acolo unde n-am loc
De acolo plec să trec prin foc 
Mai plâng dar n-am regrete
Doar praful adunat pe ghete 


Am amintiri cu trăiri cum vezi în filme
Și cu bine și cu rău, dacă ar depinde de mine
Soarta tuturor copiilor pe care-i vezi pe străzi
Să fi sigur că aș face o magie și să vezi
Zâmbetele schimbă bro orice peisaj 
Pentru că lumea în general, se ia după ambalaj
Interiorul nu contează sau poate m-am țăcănit
Ori e lumea prea nebună ori poate am îmbătrânit 
Că nu mă adaptez, toți copiii au luat-o razna
Vor semiautomate ca să-ți găurească țeasta 
În brazda lui novac am învățat să nu vorbesc
Atunci când nu e cazul pentru că pot s-o belesc
Vorbesc adevărat, mai demult nu comentai 
La unu mai mare ca tine din respect așa că hai
Să-ți mai zic o povestioară cu un bagabont pe viață
Care ntr-un final a fost șmecher doar la suprafață
Viața de cartier are o limită pe care
Dacă nu o bagi în seamă pleci devreme la culcare
Și să mori un oarecare nu e sigur o mândrie 
Îi mulțumesc lui Dumnezeu că viața mea-i o poezie


Refren x 2
Acolo unde n-am loc
De acolo plec să trec prin foc 
Mai plâng dar n-am regrete
Doar praful adunat pe ghete 


Sunt părinți care își doresc prea mult să controleze o viață
Strada poate să transforme o tocilară într-o zdreanță
O familie s-a băgat pentru o vacanța n datorii
Cămătarii nu ai milă că au și ei acas’ copii
Am văzut cu ochii mei cum o ruletă a spânzurat 
Un om care visa să ajungă putred de bogat 
Cum un halat dintr-un hotel cu multe stele l-a băgat
Pe un băiat în filme de-alea în care te vezi împărat 
Azi am mâncat niște ouă și cartofi 
Îi mulțumesc lui Dumnezeu că nu mă schimbă doi pantofi
Da lumea în care trăim, nu-i cinstită, nici modestă
Dacă apasă un buton, nu te salvează nici o vestă
Mafia, umblă cu ăla care a stat 
O perioadă după gratii pe motiv că l-a turnat
Pe ăla de trăgea pe carduri în Italia și a venit
Să se distreze o săptămână cu băieții și a mierlit
Bine ai venit în lumea în care drogurile umblă
Libere pe stradă și sunt multe cât să ajungă
La fiecare copil, da realitatea-i crudă
E important să nu fi ăla care știe să se plângă

ROCK 'N' ROLL
(Nando Reis)

Em algum momento virou o tempo 
um deslizamento 
derramou cimento 
entre a loucura e a razão

já não há silêncio
tudo é barulhento
muito movimento
pouco pensamento
sobra opinião

todos similares
carregam nas mãos seus celulares
rostos singulares 
se tornam vulgares
em meio a multidão

Mas eu ainda canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
Eu ainda canto o meu rock’n’roll

detritos nos mares 
nos rios nos lagos
todos infestados 
com enxofre, chumbo e ácido
o imundo Licor Preto

garrafas pet
cápsulas de Nespresso
como espectros
durante séculos
vagarão boiando pelos oceanos 
seus esqueletos

Não há nenhum ninho
na Grande Ilha de Lixo do Pacífico
como um urso-polar flutuando
num bloco de gelo 
a beira da extinção

eu ainda canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
eu ainda canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
 
Conservadores e liberais
usam as redes sociais
pra divulgar os seus boçais
ideais medievais
como se fossem Os Dez Novos Mandamentos

em presídios superlotados
homens trancafiados
sendo decapitados
seus corações arrancados
já não causam mais nenhum 
estranhamento

perdeu seu emprego
quando revelaram seu segredo
morrendo de medo foi crucificado
com desprezo como traidor

mas ele ainda tem o seu rock ’n’ roll
ele ainda tem o seu rock ’n’ roll

pastores e censores
delatores, promotores
senadores, corruptores
grandes trocas de favores
na maior hipocrisia e desfaçatez

as transações tenebrosas
das obras portentosas
roubam somas vultosas
bocas gananciosas
esperando cada uma a sua vez

é crime o aborto
mas não é o roubo
de um bilhão
por um pacote de biscoitos
ele passou mais de 20 anos na prisão

mas ele ainda tem o seu rock ’n’ roll
ele ainda tem o seu rock ’n’ roll

todos de vermelho
comungam de joelhos 
são fartos em conselhos
mas não olham pro espelho
evitando o constrangimento
da própria contradição

vaca amarela
guardou a panela
e a camisa amarela 
saiu da janela
Onde foi parar aquela balela
da fúria e indignação?

não tenho as certezas
dos hinos que grita a multidão
mas finco a bandeira do arco-íris
viva a liberdade de expressão!

sertanejo, gospel, hip-hop, choro
samba, funk e pagode, rap, rock ’n’ roll

a polícia dos costumes
chafurdada no estrume
manipula o seu cardume
acendendo o vagalume
aumentando o volume
da sirene odiosa da repressão

Com uma mão na Bíblia outra no coldre
repetindo seu slogan 
“dente por dente, olho por olho”
“bandido bom, bandido morto”
parece um contrassenso o argumento que armamento é proteção.

tudo é transgênico no alimento que comemos
mas negros, travestis e transgêneros
são assassinados, humilhados, 
e tratados com discriminação

com eles que eu canto esse rock ’n’ roll
é com eles que eu canto esse rock ’n’ roll

toda nudez é inocente 
até que a mente indecente 
dessa gente doente 
de língua maledicente
transforme a inocência
da nudez da gente 
somente em perversão

se deus fosse consultado
qual seria o resultado?
escolheria algum dos lados?
dos inimigos tresloucados
Lunáticos, fanáticos
por suas crenças ou religião         

Uns crêem no Gênesis
outros na Teoria da Evolução

buscando sossego
ele lê os gregos
Hesíodo e Platão

mas eu ainda tenho o meu rock ’n’ roll
eu ainda tenho meu rock ’n’ roll

na Primavera 
me disse a vera
“eu vou, não me espera”
abriu-se uma cratera 
onde havia terra
ela era a atmosfera 
e o meu chão

e eu sonho com ela
eu preciso dela
sou louco por ela
a vida sem ela 
É incongruência, desolação

o mundo não é mais o mesmo 
em que eu nasci

mas eu continuo curando a tristeza 
com a beleza de uma canção

por isso ainda canto o meu rock ’n’ roll

eu ainda canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
eu canto, eu canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
eu ainda canto, eu canto o meu rock ’n’ roll
e eu ainda canto, eu canto, eu canto o rock ’n’ roll 
eu ainda canto, eu canto, eu canto.

                     Versuri:
Soarta, a vinturat norocul nostru, prea departe
Viata, e grea dar celui ce munceste-i face parte
Credem si-atunci cind bintuiti sintem de griji si dor
Ca intr-o buna zi vom fi alaturi de cei dragi de seara pina-n zori
Haideti sa-ncep chiar de astazi vesel sa traim
Umpleti paharele cu vin si-n voie buna sa ciocnim .

Buna este urarea stamoseasca ""Sus paharul""
Scurta dar cu putere sa-ndulceasca tot amarul
Banii , citi n-ai avea sa stii ca esti un om bogat
Daca la bine si la rau prieteni buni si sinceri
Dumnezeu ti-a dat
Chiama-i si faceti o petrecere de zile mari
Caci timpul trece prea grabit si inapoi nu poti sa-l dai .

Viata viata esti frumoasa si noroc mi-ai dat
Chiar de vremuri grele-am apucat
Nu m-ai suparat chiar de mai certat tot mai aprins uneori
Viata viata nu ma lasa dorul ne-impacat
Si atunci cind trec al casei prag
Cit voi mai trai stiu ca-l voi simti tot arzator .

Refren :
Hop hei,hop hei,suna toata Europa,opa opa hopa hopa
Hop hei,hop hei, cind dansam noi mai cu foc opa opa hopa hop
Uite-asa sint moldovenii, hop hop si-asa
Nu mai stiu de timpuri grele hop hop hop
Caci legati sint cu fratie hop hop si-asa

Lyrics:

The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow,
An' so am I.
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime,
But it's July.
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute.
My boss just pushed me over the limit.
I'd like to call him somethin',
I think I'll just call it a day.

Pour me somethin' tall an' strong,
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane.
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care.
It's five o'clock somewhere.

Check out our special Christmas version of this video here: http://youtu.be/ugV6QGcafEE

We love the Holiday Season. Why? It's a great excuse to be extra nice to each other. =) ... And we love Christmas music, lights, presents, and the excitement of our sleepless children anticipating the advent of Christmas day. We know there are many out there who do not celebrate Christmas or believe in what it may represent. This song is not meant to exclude anyone. We hope this song is an opportunity to reflect on everything we are blessed with in life -- family, a beautiful earth, a place to rest our head, the warmth of the sun. The lyrics of this piece speak of being ""ransomed"" from captivity. In general terms, at some point or another in our lives we find ourselves at the receiving end of a ""ransom"" -- a rescue by someone or something -- even as simple as a note from a friend, a hug from a child, a much-needed vacation, or the unconditional affection of a loyal dog. That is what this song represents to us. People may define the ""rescue"" moments in life differently, but the meaning of the moments remain the same. To many, including us, the story of The Savior is the sweetest and most priceless ""ransom"" of all. To Him we dedicate this song.

And with this video we wish everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a bright future filled with ""rescue"" moments. We love you!

A thousand THANK YOUs to John Garbett and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for allowing us access to their beautiful Jerusalem Movie Set where this was filmed. We felt transported to the Holy Land as we played music and filmed there. It was an incredible experience.

And many many thanks to Marshall McDonald, an incredible friend and example who co-wrote this arrangement.

Lyrics to O Come, Emmanuel 
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
Who orderest all things mightily;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And teach us in her ways to go.
[Refrain]
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save,
And give them victory over the grave.
[Refrain]
O come, Thou Day-spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight.
[Refrain]
O come, Thou Key of David, come,
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.
[Refrain]
O come, O come, great Lord of might,
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times once gave the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.
[Refrain]
O come, Thou Root of Jesse's tree,
An ensign of Thy people be;
Before Thee rulers silent fall;
All peoples on Thy mercy call.
[Refrain]
O come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of Peace

BEIJO DE VARANDA
(Lari Ferreira / Danillo Dávilla / Elcio Di Carvalho / Junior Pepato)

Todo santo dia, é mais um dia pra te esquecer
Acabei de ouvir a nossa música no rádio e na TV
O que será que isso quer dizer?

Tava ali fazendo palavra cruzada
Pra ver se o tempo passa
E o seu nome apareceu
Agora à pouco um vídeo no Youtube
E como de costume sabe o que aconteceu
Aquela cena veio e acabou comigo
No terceiro replay eu já tinha me convencido
Que falta você

Nem vou culpar o vento por essa bagunça
Se fui eu que deixei a janela aberta
Então é minha culpa ai ai
E já que entrou na minha vida, leve é toda a sua
Quero aquele beijo de varanda e a lua de testemunha
Eu tô até com ciúme
O vento deve estar usando o seu perfume

Tim was the man. As a teenager he dreamt of making it big in the United States and immigrated to America dead set on never returning home again. However, just a few years later, he got kicked out of the country for smoking pot in a stolen car. After a few years back in Brazil he revolutionized Brazilian popular music and became one of the greatest soul artists of his lifetime. He married five times (or did he?), served multiple prison sentences (that's for sure), and at the height of his fame joined that UFO-obsessed religious cult -- how about that?",634,367,0,1,18923,2012-10-09 23:48:08,0,"Tim Maia, Tim, Maia, Racional Energy, Cultura Racional, Tim Maia (Musical Artist), Universe in Disenchantment, Brazil, live music, Live Music (Record Label), documentary, world, soul, disco, 1970, UFO, cult, alien",Tim Maia - O Caminho Do Bem,hwUGJXm02ZQ,4756598,CMgBEAA,o,0,12,10,9,283,1,6.6772964489269375,3.0629578340845103,4.276989989368231,2.8020892578817334,6,41,0.15357142857142855,121,0.004545454545454542,17,0.0,6,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0.640527198707129,0.4587122733747634,1.5263575124660604,0,0,1.0

0,Ti Ger,3344,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Der Banana Boat Song („Bananenboot-Lied"") ist ein jamaikanisches Calypso-Volkslied. Der Song geht zurück auf ein altes jamaikanisches Volkslied mit dem Titel ""Day dah light"", das von Schauerleuten handelt, die in Nachtschicht Bananen verluden und über ihre Arbeit sangen. 
Sie erlebten den Tagesanbruch und das damit einhergehende Schichtende: ""Daylight come and me wanna go home"". Dieser Refrain ist ebenso wie die Melodie allen frühen, traditionellen Versionen des Liedes gemeinsam. Die Strophen variierten jedoch und wurden oft wahrscheinlich aus dem Stegreif erfunden.

LETRA:
Garoto escute aqui: eu sou aquela que sempre te apoiou, te fez feliz
Tu pode até tentar, mas eu garanto nenhuma melhor que eu vai arrumar
Lembra na escola quando eu te olhava e você não me dava bola
Sonhava com você andando de mãos dadas, mas o mundo girou e olha como eu tô agora

Tô bem, tô zen
Vivendo e aprendendo, não devo nada pra ninguém
Você me esnobava, agora te esnobo também

Mais uma vez a vida vem me ensinar
Quando tiver afim de mim, a sua mente vai lembrar de tudo que eu fiz por você
Não deu valor antigamente agora que não vai me ter
Mas sei que uma hora ou outra vai acabar pensando em mim
Seu coração vai disparar
E quando menos perceber vai ver que não estou aí

Com o foco de levar o amor de Cristo a multidões, a visibilidade de suas ministrações se encontra expressiva nas redes sociais, superando o número de 900 milhões de acessos no YouTube. 

Em junho de 2005, com 11 anos, Gabriela iniciou sua carreira participando do concurso Jovens Talentos no programa de TV nacional Raul Gil, após diversas disputas, em maio de 2007, ganhou o concurso.

A partir de 2008, participou diversas vezes do programa Raul Gil no quadro “Homenagem ao Artista” interpretando sucessos de cantores da música gospel emocionando o Brasil com sua voz.

Gabriela está fortemente presente em suas redes sociais, com mais de 9 milhões de seguidores, que podem acompanhar postagens sobre mensagens de Deus, clips, novidades, campanhas com premiações, além de vídeos ao vivo onde ela interage diretamente com seu público.
 
Em 2011, Gabriela participou do CD e DVD ao vivo do cantor Thalles Roberto, cantando a canção “Nada Além de Ti”, sucesso nas rádios, igrejas e redes sociais.

No final de 2012, Gabriela lançou seu primeiro CD, de nome “Jesus”, onde as canções se espalharam pelo Brasil, como “Estas Comigo” e “Creio que Tu és a Cura”, o clip dessa última já ultrapassou 70 milhões de visualizações. 

Em Novembro de 2014, Gabriela lançou seu 2º CD ""Pra Onde Iremos?"", com uma pegada mais Pop-Rock e com letras de profunda intimidade com Deus e exaltação ao Deus Todo Poderoso. O álbum contou com a participação do cantor Leonardo Gonçalves na linda música “Nossa Canção”.

Em 2015, foi a primeira artista da Sony a participar do projeto Sony Music Live, lançando vídeos ao vivo de todas as músicas do CD “Pra Onde Iremos”.
Ainda em 2015, Gabriela participou do CD e DVD “Preto no Branco” em duas canções, com destaque para a música “Ninguém Explica Deus” que está com quase 150 milhões de visualizações.

No início de 2016, já nos preparativos para o DVD, Gabriela lançou 3 lindas músicas inéditas que rapidamente se espalharam pelo Brasil.

Em marco de 2016, aos 22 anos, Gabriela gravou seu primeiro DVD ao vivo. Com o título “Ate Transbordar”, o DVD foi uma verdadeira noite de adoração onde as pessoas presentes cantavam todas as canções, incluindo as novas “Atos 2”, “Me Aproximou” e ""Meu Salvador"", além das faixas dos primeiros CDs “Creio que Tu és a Cura”, “Nada Além de Ti”, “Eu Sou Teu”, “Teu Santo Nome”, “Gratidão”, entre outras. O DVD contou também com as participações de Fernandinho (“Creio em Ti”), Felippe Valadão (""Pra Onde Iremos”) e Leonardo Gonçalves (""Nossa Canção”).

Kuratorki wystawy opowiadają o kolekcji, którą Ignacy Jan Paderewski podarował Muzeum Narodowemu w Warszawie, a także o samym darczyńcy – wybitnym i charyzmatycznym artyście, najsławniejszym Polaku swoich czasów, polityku i mężu stanu, jednym z ojców polskiej niepodległości.

-----

17 lutego – 20 maja 2018

Przypadająca w 2018 roku setna rocznica odzyskania przez Polskę niepodległości jest doskonałą okazją do przypomnienia działalności politycznej i kulturalnej Ignacego Jana Paderewskiego. Obrazy, rysunki, zdjęcia i inne zabytki pochodzące z jego daru dla Muzeum Narodowego w Warszawie ukazują niezwykłe zaangażowanie muzyka i męża stanu w propagowanie sprawy niepodległości Polski na całym świecie oraz późniejszą karierę polityczną, m.in. piastowanie funkcji premiera rządu odrodzonej Rzeczypospolitej. To także okazja, by przypomnieć Paderewskiego jako kolekcjonera cennych dzieł sztuki, które gromadził w ukochanym domu w Riond-Bosson nieopodal Jeziora Genewskiego, a potem ofiarował narodowi.
Wystawa w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie przedstawia sylwetkę sławnego pianisty przez pryzmat przekazanych przez niego zabytków i pamiątek. Są one pretekstem do opowieści o Paderewskim oraz otaczających go ludziach – znaczących postaciach ówczesnej sceny politycznej i artystycznej. Zaprezentowane dzieła ukazują różne oblicza wirtuoza, zarówno te bardziej znane – wielkiego muzyka, męża stanu i przyjaciela wielkich tamtego świata, jak i mniej – człowieka oddanego rodzinie i kolekcjonera sztuki dalekowschodniej.
Po raz pierwszy możemy oglądać znakomitą większość dzieł sztuki jakie złożyły się na wspaniały dar Paderewskiego dla Muzeum. Wśród eksponowanych obiektów znajdują się między innymi koncertowy fortepian mistrza, wykonany dla niego przez firmę Steinway & Sons, oraz portret Paderewskiego pędzla jednego z najsłynniejszych akademików XIX stulecia – Lawrence’a Alma-Tademy. O wielkiej sławie Ignacego Paderewskiego świadczą prezenty, które wręczali mu przyjaciele i miłośnicy jego twórczości. Wśród nich m.in. zdjęcie królowej Wiktorii z autografem, tryptyk Muzyka Jacka Malczewskiego oraz teka grafik Leona Wyczółkowskiego z dedykacją. Fotografie przedstawiające życie rodzinne Paderewskiego umożliwiają poznanie jego domu w Szwajcarii oraz członków rodziny. Wyjątkowa jest kolekcja sztuki dalekowschodniej, obejmująca m.in. chińską porcelanę, emalie, szkło i wyroby z laki, które Paderewski wraz z małżonką gromadzili w swojej szwajcarskiej willi.
Wystawie towarzyszą bogaty program wydarzeń oraz ilustrowany katalog w polsko-angielskiej wersji językowej.

Los-Angeles native Connie Lim, better known as MILCK, has been singing for as long as she can remember. She began crafting her talent at a young age by enrolling in classical piano and opera classes. Inspired by artist from Frederic Chopin to Radiohead and Imogen Heap, she experienced something of an awakening in her college's underground piano rooms.

""English by birth, Irish by extraction, Canadian by adoption, and Scotch by absorption,"" Healey Willan (1880-1968) was Precentor at the church of St. Mary Magdalene, Toronto from 1921 until his death, and in that capacity composed a major body of liturgical works.  Written in 1957 for the Southern Conference of the American Lutheran Church, ""O Adonai"" is the second of the seven Great O Antiphons of Advent, so named because they all begin with the letter O.  Associated with the seven days before Christmas, each antiphon takes as its theme one of the names or attributes of Christ; their combined texts were later paraphrased in the hymn ""O come, O come Emmanuel.""  Willan's settings, redolent of plainsong, share common musical ideas but each is subtly responsive to its individual text.",0,81,0,0,15,2011-12-03 23:16:19,0,"choir, choral music sacred, Advent, Christmas",O Adonai by Healey Willan,CVy2ZXJrjDo,4291,CN4CEAA,o,0,11,12,3,337,5,3.632558514532672,0.4771212547196624,1.1760912590556811,0.0,3,48,0.028117715617715627,208,0.0,3,0.0,4,0,3,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,25,0.323763885523255,0.13134578639569253,10.0,1,0,1.0

And I believed

เหนื่อยล้าเหลือเกินกับสิ่งที่ฉันผ่านมา
อยากจะมีใครสักคนมาคอยปลอบโยนใจ
ไม่รู้จะมีบ้างไหม มีแค่สุราที่คอยปลอบหทัย
ไม่ชอบเท่าไหร่หรอกเหล้า
ฉันก็แค่อยากเมาให้หลับไหล
แล้วจะมีใครบ้างไหม ที่จะฟังเสียงฉัน
ว่าฉันเป็นอยู่ อย่างไร
ฉันไม่ได้รักเหล้าหรอก ถึงฉันจะเมาประจํา
ฉันแค่ต้องการ ฟังเสียงคนนั้น 
ว่าหยุดเถอะเหล้า เราอยู่ตรงนี้ 

เธอจะรู้ไหม ว่าใจฉันคอยคิดถึง
และฉันก็คนหนึ่ง ที่มันรักเธอจนหมดใจ
เธอได้ยินฉันไหม ในใจฉันคอยคิดถึง
อยากตะโกนบอกเธอคําหนึ่ง
ว่าใจดวงนี้ มันรักเธอ

คำว่ารักที่มีให้เธอ ไม่เคยไปไหน
อยากให้เธอได้รู้ it goes be alright 
และจะมีเพียงเธอ และต่อจากนี้ไป
และไม่ว่าเธอนั้น เคยทำฉันนั้นซ้ำสักเท่าไร  
อยากให้เธอลองคิด อยากให้เธอลองทบทวน 
คำว่ารักที่ฉันมี มันอาจดูไม่สมควร 
เพราะว่าเธอมีเขาแล้วฉันนั้นก็ยังไปกวน 
แค่อยากให้เธอได้รู้ ว่าใจดวงนี้มันมีแค่เธอ

ฉันยังคงคิดถึงแม้ว่าเธอเป็นของเค้า
ฉันยังคงนึกถึงแต่เรื่องเดิมๆของเรา
เธอคงไม่จำเพราะเธอหมดรักแล้วไง
เธอบอกว่ารักมากมายสุดท้ายเธอก็ไป
เธอบอกว่าเธอนั้นรักฉันที่สุดในโลกเลย
แต่มาวันนี้ทำไมฉันรู้สึกเหมือนโดนหลอกเลย
เธอบอกว่ารักมากรักมาก 
จะบอกไปเพื่อไรสุดท้ายเธอก็ไป

เธอจะรู้ไหม ว่าใจฉันคอยคิดถึง
และฉันก็คนหนึ่ง ที่มันรักเธอจนหมดใจ

LYRICS
Been traveling in packs that I can’t carry anymore 
Been waiting for somebody else to carry me
There’s nothing else there for me at my door
All the people I knew aren’t who they used to be
                                                                                               
And if I tried to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can’t change into a person I don’t wanna be so
Oh it’s Saturday night

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama can I get another amen
Oh
It’s Saturday night
 
Swear to God I ain’t ever gonna repent
Mama can I get another amen
Oh
It’s Saturday night
                                                                                               
And every morning when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn’t say I’d ever been
But it’s so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowing
that I gave everything that i had to give
Then it’s all I could have asked for
I’ve been standing up beside everything I’ve ever said but
Oh it’s Saturday night
                                                                                               
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama can I get another amen
Oh
It’s Saturday night
 
Swear to God I ain’t ever gonna repent
Mama can I get another amen
Oh
It’s Saturday night
And if I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
And if I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better but baby

LYRICS
This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories
(This is the beat of my heart)
Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me, let me go
These words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
Truth be told, I never was yours
The fear of falling apart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors
(This is the beat of my heart)
Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive

LYRICS
Welcome to the end of eras
Ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Dynasty decapitated
You just might see a ghost tonight

And if you don't know now you know...

I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah
The crown...
So close I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah

Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than Royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

Mortal kings are ruling castles

Lyrics:

White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw, I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope, tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold,
But there's nothing to grasp so I let go

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much

LYRICS:

Alright, alright
It’s a helluva feeling though
Who are these people
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should prob’ly introduce myself
You shoulda seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
was the king of this hologram 
Where there’s no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs
Don’t think I’ll ever get enough 
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying if you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe
Oh yeah
Don’t threaten me with a good time
What are these footprints
They don’t look very human like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can’t even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor’s pool
Upside down with a perfect view
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don’t think I’ll ever get it now
I’m a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don’t fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I’ve told you time and time again
I’m not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down as the sun came up
I think we’ve had enough",9416,225,0,1,449741,2016-05-10 14:01:53,0,"Panic!

LYRICS: 

You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
The neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies

Lyrics:
So, have you heard of the house on the hill
I hear it's haunted, and crawling with all types of evil
But I am not afraid of any legends or lores
And I want answers to what might be behind all these doors
Knocking and waiting for some sort of reply
It seems there's nobody in here, and I want to know why
I can feel a shiver crawling way up my spine
but I know there's something that's waiting at the end of the line

Another door, another question
I'm going 'round in circles, wond'ring when I'll reach the end
I'm losing the sense of where I am
The hallways got longer and all the walls have turned red

I’ve come to, 900, hands covered in sores
Now there are only, 100 of these spine-chilling doors
But I just can’t imagine what could be at the end
and I am hoping, it’s all worth it to my little friend
Spooky, what is it that you’re hiding from me?
I feel there’s something, that’s missing don’t know what it could be
 I just finished opening nine hundred and three
Will I survive it, until the end there’s no guarantee


So many doors, so many questions
My eyes are getting heavy and I just want it to end
I'm losing, my grip on reality
I’ve seen no one else here and now I fear I am dead

There’s just a few more doors, it won’t take many more… just one at a time
You’ve got your axe in hand, everything’s gonna be fine in the end… or so she pretends
Oh Spooky I’ve got a bone, to pick with you when I’m done, with your little game
I open the last door… don’t know what’s in store…

The final, encounter, was so unforeseen
Everything I thought, of Spooky wasn't quite what it seemed
The evidence I came across gave me just the thing
To understand more, of Spooky and her sad upbringing
Lost and, so lonely and so misunderstood
Turns out the thing she, loved most to do had done her in good
The shock of what had happened lasted year after year
And so the family, did everything to make her appear

The final door, the ultimatum
Surrounded by a thousand and I can’t help but give in
Our mission, to change our history
The people will think twice when visited by Spooky

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

clean

I was always in a fight cuz I can't do nothin'

I can't take the person starin' back at me 
I'm a hazard to myself

I'm my own worst enemy

LYRICS
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sins she's paid for

A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words were swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you've paid for

Say what you mean
Tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign
I want to believe

Woah, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Woah, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say
She would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean
Tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign
I want to believe

Woah, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Woah, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Mona Lisa wear me out
Pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa wear me out

Say what you mean
Tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign
I want to believe

Woah, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Woah, Mona Lisa

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
 
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

LYRICS
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah we're feeling so good

Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?

Back to the place
Where we used to say
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place,
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do

Lyrics:

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus:]
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus:]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh""",217220,308,0,1,6655250,2013-10-02 14:00:06,1,"john legend channel, JohnLegendvevo, all of me official, wake up!, acoustic, john legend all of me, video, music, instrumental, evolver, john legend lyrics, All Of Me, vevo, Chrissy Teigen, reggae, Love in the Future, john legend, get lifted, r and b, official, soul, Love Me Now, once again, You and I, download, Tonight, think like a man, the roots, karaoke, remix, lyrics, audio, cover rock, official video, cover, all of me live, love, in, the",John Legend - All of Me (Edited Video),450p7goxZqg,1359598322,CKwCEAA,p,0,13,10,2,275,2,9.133410619910293,5.215592624979943,6.8231643740978765,5.336899809359535,9,40,0.3838468720821662,170,0.3272727272727273,38,0.0,7,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0.7470554711756617,0.5710454552005207,1.2784883767410848,0,0,1.0

I hear you makin all that noise 
About the world you want to see 
And I’m so annoyed 
Cause I just killed off what was left 
Of the optimist in me 
Hearts are breaking 
Wars are raging on 
And I have taken
My glasses off 
You got me nervous
I’m right at the end of my rope 
A half-empty girl 
Don’t make me laugh, I’ll choke

Just let me cry!

I wish we were all rose-colored, too 
My rose-colored boy

Low key no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

And I want you to stop 
Insisting that I’m not 
A lost cause 
Cause I been through a lot 
Really all I’ve got is just to stay pissed off 
If it’s alright by you 

But hearts are breaking 
And wars are raging on 
And I have taken 
My glasses off 
You got me nervous 
When you’re turning it into a joke 
A half-empty girl 
Don’t make me laugh, I’ll…

Just let me cry!

Hey man, we all can’t be like you 
I wish we were all rose-colored, too 
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer 
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don’t want anybody seeing me cry now 
You say we gotta look on the bright side 
I say well maybe if you wanna go blind 
You say my eyes are getting too dark now 
But boy you ain’t ever seen my mind

Just let me cry!

Lyrics:

Where have you been?
Where have you gone?
And have I done something wrong?
You're the Tooth Fairy
You're like Santa Claus
You're like white noise
When I want my favorite song

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier?
How come you're not here?
Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high?

Lyrics:

The truth about love comes at 3am
You wake up fucked up and you grab a pen
And you say to yourself
I'm gonna figure it out, I'm gonna crack that code
Gonna break it break it down
I'm tired of all these questions
And, now it's just annoying
Cause, no one has the answer
So I guess it's up to me
To find the truth about love
As it comes, and it goes
A strange fascination with his lips and toes
Morning breath, bedroom eyes on a smiling face
Sheet marks rug burn, and a sugar glaze
The shock and the awe that can eat you raw
If the truth about love

I think it just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And The Truth About Love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes",575,230,0,1,19460,2012-09-13 07:00:17,1,"Pink The Truth About Love, Perfect, acoustic, The Truth About Love Official Video, music, Funhouse, instrumental, Interview, Just Give Me A Reason, vevo, official, download, karaoke, remix, lyrics, Sober, audio, official video, cover, Pink Live, The Truth About Love Live, Sony, The Truth About Love Lyrics, So What, PinkVEVO, music video, Pink, playlist, single, album, live, Raise Your Glass, hq, P!nk, Pop, RCA Records Label, The, Truth, About",P!nk - The Truth About Love (Official Lyric Video),HMwm2xwoQjg,3641770,CN4CEAA,p,0,12,9,13,257,3,6.5613125139781125,2.9319661147281737,4.289142835932333,2.7596678446896306,6,37,0.19068376068376067,202,0.2413586413586413,38,0.375,8,0,1,1,2,1,3,2,0,2,4,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,2,0,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,50,0.6537019577706158,0.4468566477335077,1.5542243042711965,0,0,1.0

A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile.
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while.

But february made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver.
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn't take one more step.

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride,
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died.

So bye-bye, miss american pie.
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Did you write the book of love,
And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so? 
Do you believe in rock 'n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 

Well, I know that you're in love with him
`cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.
You both kicked off your shoes.
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died.

I started singin',
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,
But that's not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the king and queen,
In a coat he borrowed from james dean
And a voice that came from you and me,

Oh, and while the king was looking down,
The jester stole his thorny crown.
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned.
And while lennon read a book of marx,
The quartet practiced in the park,
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died.

We were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter.
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
Eight miles high and falling fast.
It landed foul on the grass.
The players tried for a forward pass,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune.
We all got up to dance,
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield.
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died? 

We started singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Oh, and there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again.
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell.
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite,
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news,
But she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before,
But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

And in the streets: the children screamed,
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost,
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.

And they were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Lyrics:
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up

It was a crush
Now I might have went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept saying I'mma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up, ooh

No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah the sun won't set on us

Yeah! Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worry

Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same

I was ready to give you my name

[Zara Larsson:]
I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til theday I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)
'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)

[MNEK:]
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what would happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do youthink could ever take you off my mind (take you off my mind)

[Zara Larsson:]
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Both:]
Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
That I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

Te fuiste de aquí, sin pensarlo. 
Dijiste que no me amabas más. 
Yo te supliqué, quédate aquí. 
Yo no sé que haría sin tí, no creo soportarlo. 

Te fuiste de aquí, todo ha acabado. 
Y llora mi alma en soledad.

Lyrics:
See them walking hand in hand
Across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out
Are so bright
And walk right out to the four line track
There's a camera rolling on her back
On her back
And I sense a rhythm humming in a frenzy
All the way down her spine
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
And miles of sharp blue water coming in
Where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair
By the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here
As she goes under again
Girls on film (two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (got your picture)
Girls on film
Wider, baby, smile and you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close
I'm holding bright
Holding tight
Give me shudders in a whisper
Take me up 'til I'm shooting a star
Girls on film (she's more than a lady)
Girls on film
Girls on film (two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (see you together)
Girls on film
Girls on film (see you later)

As all the covers are not on ""The Q-Music Sessions"", I decided to make a video with all the covers + Smells Like Teen Spirit, which was not considered as a ""WT Friday Cover""

Unfortunately, I couldn't have all the covers in good quality for the beginning or the end of the song, so I did my best to make it listenable ;)

✘  About me...

 Born and raised in Bulgaria, currently living in Munich, Germany, I start listening to hip-hop when I was 12. I discovered the culture through legendary names such as KRS-One, Public Enemy, Biggie, Nas, Guru and Pac. 
I started making beats as soon as my mom bought me a 150 $ second hand PC and I found a way to instal Fruity Loops on it.
 My work is highly influenced by Premier, J Dilla, 9th Wonder, Just Blaze, Alchemist and Pete Rock. Even though the boombap sound is in the center of my production I constantly try to experiment and incorporate different genres and sounds in my music. Here I upload some compilations of classic instrumental music and also my beat tapes, my instrumentals and my own sounds...

Could I lock in your love, baby?

What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest? (never)

Never

Have you ever seen a new helicopter?
Straight off the blocka
This little Nicki grew up to be monster
You deserve to be mama
Twinkle twinkle, her sparkle'll blind ya
You and me is a must, girl
You shy like the first day of school
Got me some weed if you cool on the booze
Lie on the couch while I drool on your boobs
Naw, I'm just kiddin', just kiddin' to you
Take you to heaven, pit stop at the moon
Stuntin' July til the month after June
Hang on my arm while we freeze up the room
Girl, you the bomb won't you take it and boom, boom

Now I've got you in my space

โดนใจชาวร็อคแบบเต็มๆ สำหรับวง Q (คิว) ซึ่งประกอบไปด้วย หมู, วอร์, เป๊ก และโหน่ง อัลบั้ม Q เป็นอัลบั้มแรกที่ออกมาเขย่าวงการร็อกรุ่นเล็กให้สั่นสะเทือน เพลงเปิดตัวของอัลบั้มนี้ คือ “รู้นะ” เพลงรักเต็มร็อกที่กระแทกอารมณ์สุดๆ “หรือผู้หญิงชอบคนเลว” เพลงเข้าซึ้งถึงหัวอกของผู้ชาย หรือ “ฝาก” ที่ได้นักร้องสาวเสียงคุณภาพ ซอ The sis มาร่วมร้องในเพลงนี้ด้วย

คำปลอบโยน

อึดอัดใจไหม  ที่ยังทนยังทำว่ารักกัน
แกล้งเป็นว่ารักฉัน  ทั้งที่ใจเธอมีแต่เขา
ตั้งแต่วันนั้น  วันที่เธอกับเขาได้พบกัน
เรื่องจริงหรือความฝัน  เธอเปลี่ยนไปได้ถึงเพียงนี้

ความรักที่เคยหวาน  ของสองเรา
วันนี้มันจืดจาง  อึดอัดใจ
เธอก็ไปกับเขาได้เลย  อย่าฝืน

หากหมดรัก  ก็จากไป
ปล่อยไว้  ยิ่งปวดใจ
ถ้าทั้งใจมีเขาอยู่
ไม่ต้องหา  คำปลอบโยน
สุดท้าย  เธอก็ไป
คำลา  คำเดียวก็พอ
ไม่ต้องมายื้ออีกแล้ว  หมดใจก็ไปเหอะเธอ

อย่ามาปลอบฉัน  ไม่กี่วันใจฉันก็ลืมเธอ
ลืมเธอได้เสมอ  เจ็บแค่นี้คงไม่ถึงตาย
จบเพียงเท่านี้  สิ่งดีดี ที่เคยฝันร่วมกัน
ไปอยู่กับคนนั้น  คนที่เธอสบายทั้งกายและใจ",1867,300,0,1,30573,2014-08-13 07:05:31,0,"rs, อาร์เอส, mv, มิวสิควิดีโอ, คิว, หรือผู้หญิงชอบคนเลว, คำปลอบโยน, ฝาก",คำปลอบโยน : Q [Official Lyric Video],sS268D4muu8,11260285,CGQQAA,q,0,14,8,13,225,2,7.051549382732109,3.3758464363091565,4.485338056309354,3.2711443179490782,7,33,0.0,75,0.0,7,0.25,5,0,1,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,36,0.6360783726897078,0.4787382535497739,1.3711831763881157,0,0,1.0

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Every time that I wake up I swear I'm never down
Even when I'm in my dreams I'm high off self-esteem
Blowing on that Jamaica my niggas not a team
Marijuana fiend
Keep your black & mild's and cigs cause me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Moosa as we pulled up on them 6's
Just to go and bust some bitches
See the mothafuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with some tints
That Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel
Like the orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a xanny or a klonopin
All your swishas they be model thin
We plus sized nigga
Like Tocarra and them
Shining like a halogen
Soul bright like high beams, headlights at midnight
Like one of Rhode Island's watch tower sights (Yeah)
The world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Hook]
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything
Know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money man
But bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed
Who, who got some weed
Who, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed

[Verse 2]
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a Corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour dies'
Make a order, it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it til we on E
Then we fill up again with another ten
Then we just go run back to the chiefs for filler
Family needs, no worries
Smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of three's
We dying up in every plea
So for y'all my niggas, swear to God my heart'll bleed
Kickin' shit for my lifers and ones who get ?
Even if it's just five dollars just keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind, cause in due time you'll wine and dine
Somethin' fine, and that kush blunt soon be your valentine
And my shit be Columbine
My friends is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Hook]
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything
Know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money man
But bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed
Who her? She got some weed
Who him? He got some weed
My Aunt, She got some weed

SONHEI QUE TAVA ME CASANDO
(Elvis Elan / Henrique Casttro / Montenegro / Gabriel do Cavaco / Shylton Fernandes)

Hoje é o dia que vai mudar a minha vida,
Tô no altar , já vai começar...

Violino tocando, a noiva do lado
Coração acelerado, aliança chegou
Igreja lotada, o padre perguntou

Tem alguém contra essa união aqui presente
Fale agora ou cale-se pra sempre

Eu olhei pra trás, meus amigos chorando,
Meus amores antigos com pena me olhando
Ainda bem
Cai da cama com o celular tocando

Sonhei que tava me casando
Acordei em desespero
Vida de casado é boa
Só perde pra de solteiro (2x)

Lyrics:

Quizas despues de ti yo termine siendo uno mas
Que no te enamoras, llegue yo a escuchar
Hay varias cosas que tenemos que intentar
Y queria aprovechar

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal
Tu eres lo que quiero
Escuche que eres fria como el hielo
Un angel que callo del cielo
Y entro a la maldad

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Envuelves con tu cuerpo
Todos te tienen ganas
Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

El trafico para
Mientras cruce me miraban
Con ellos no quiero nada
Se lo digo con una mirada
Dicen que soy malvada
Y fria como el invierno
Ellos se mueren por un beso
Pero es dificil la jugada
Querias comprobar porque dicen que yo soy criminal
Vas a ver como esto va a terminar
Te queria contar que

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

Te quiero aunque no sea yo el primero Despacio que tu amor es muy ligero Permiteme un minuto mas Acostumbras a tratarlos mal
Pero creo que conmigo eso puede cambiar Pero solo

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal

Sabes lo que quiero
Muchos como tu yo he visto pasajero Haciendome subir del suelo
Por algo temporal

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

I too, initially thought it was a man singing, but knowing that it is not, does not detract from the fact that the song is amazing and powerful. The song lyrics and composition by William Garvey (who died in 2009) and sung by Q Lazzarus.
Actual lyrics are :-

GOODBYE HORSES
He told me, ""I've seen it rise,
But, it always falls.
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go.""

He said, ""All things pass into the night.""

And I said, ""Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
I must disagree, Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
Won't you listen to me?""

He told me, ""I've seen it all before, 
I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams
lying on the ground.
I've seen the sky, just begin to fall.""

He said, ""All things pass into the night"" 
And I said, ""Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
I must disagree, Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
Won't you listen to me.""

Goodbye horses, I'm flying over you.
Goodbye horses, I'm flying over you.

---You can check this, by going to William Garvey's website.  http://www.garveymusic.com/
    It's a woman singing about a man (sung in past tense), and what he's telling her is all very negative, to which she disagrees. It's pretty simplistic in it's verses. The 'Goodbye Horses' lyric is clearly a metaphor. There are no horses in the song.
    Basically, it's the mind we're talking about here. 'Goodbye Horses' is saying goodbye to the mind. So it could just be Death on the whole. I believe Garvey intended the song to be quite uplifting, however, he didn't have control over Q Lazzarus' voice. But as with any song, it's all down to interpretation (well, unless the singer says otherwise and screws that up)
     A lot of people say 'Goodbye Horses' is about drugs, namely, cocaine. But there isn't really any indication to that. On the flipside to the 'Goodbye Horses' vinyl, is a song called 'White Lines', which could easily be misconstrued as being about cocaine, but the lyric within the song goes 'White lines over the ocean'. But even if the song is a reference to cocaine, it does not mean that 'Goodbye Horses' is.
    'Goodbye Horses' was not written for the movie 'The Silence Of The Lambs (1991 Jonathan Demme)'. The song was written and released in 1988, a month after the book (by Thomas Harris) was released. The song appeared in 'Married To The Mob' (another Demme movie) which was released in theatres across America a month after the books release, thus making it impossible.

Unfortunately Q Lazzarus only made a few songs and they are very hard to come by:-
     'The Candle Goes Away', which featured in the 1986 movie 'Something Wild' staring Melanie Griffith, i believe (another Demme movie) .
     'White Lines' which appeared on the flipside to the 'Goodbye Horses' vinyl.
     'Heaven' (a cover of 'The Talking Heads') which appeared in the film 'Philadelphia' (yet another Demme movie), which you can see a clip of (on YouTube) under the title.. 'Soul Song In The End Of The Party', you even see Q herself, seemingly wearing the same jacket as on the Goodbye Horses cover sleeve, and wearing a hat. Unfortunately the song seems to be an in-movie song, and thus not a proper recording.
     Also, Q Lazzarus wrote and composed music, alongside Danny Z, for a movie named 'Twisted' by director  Seth Michael Donsky released in 1996. I read a review of the film by someone, who said 'that the movie should of just been a 2 hour MTV music video, which could mean (not certain) that Q lazzarus sings some other songs...here's hoping.

Gabriela tem louvado ao Senhor por todo Brasil e impactado vidas através de suas ministrações com autenticidade e personalidade. Com o foco de levar o amor de Cristo a multidões, a visibilidade de suas ministrações se encontra expressiva nas redes sociais, superando o número de 900 milhões de acessos no YouTube. 

Em junho de 2005, com 11 anos, Gabriela iniciou sua carreira participando do concurso Jovens Talentos no programa de TV nacional Raul Gil, após diversas disputas, em maio de 2007, ganhou o concurso.

A partir de 2008, participou diversas vezes do programa Raul Gil no quadro “Homenagem ao Artista” interpretando sucessos de cantores da música gospel emocionando o Brasil com sua voz.

Gabriela está fortemente presente em suas redes sociais, com mais de 9 milhões de seguidores, que podem acompanhar postagens sobre mensagens de Deus, clips, novidades, campanhas com premiações, além de vídeos ao vivo onde ela interage diretamente com seu público.
 
Em 2011, Gabriela participou do CD e DVD ao vivo do cantor Thalles Roberto, cantando a canção “Nada Além de Ti”, sucesso nas rádios, igrejas e redes sociais.

No final de 2012, Gabriela lançou seu primeiro CD, de nome “Jesus”, onde as canções se espalharam pelo Brasil, como “Estas Comigo” e “Creio que Tu és a Cura”, o clip dessa última já ultrapassou 70 milhões de visualizações. 

Em Novembro de 2014, Gabriela lançou seu 2º CD ""Pra Onde Iremos?"", com uma pegada mais Pop-Rock e com letras de profunda intimidade com Deus e exaltação ao Deus Todo Poderoso. O álbum contou com a participação do cantor Leonardo Gonçalves na linda música “Nossa Canção”.

Em 2015, foi a primeira artista da Sony a participar do projeto Sony Music Live, lançando vídeos ao vivo de todas as músicas do CD “Pra Onde Iremos”.
Ainda em 2015, Gabriela participou do CD e DVD “Preto no Branco” em duas canções, com destaque para a música “Ninguém Explica Deus” que está com quase 150 milhões de visualizações.

No início de 2016, já nos preparativos para o DVD, Gabriela lançou 3 lindas músicas inéditas que rapidamente se espalharam pelo Brasil.

Em marco de 2016, aos 22 anos, Gabriela gravou seu primeiro DVD ao vivo. Com o título “Ate Transbordar”, o DVD foi uma verdadeira noite de adoração onde as pessoas presentes cantavam todas as canções, incluindo as novas “Atos 2”, “Me Aproximou” e ""Meu Salvador"", além das faixas dos primeiros CDs “Creio que Tu és a Cura”, “Nada Além de Ti”, “Eu Sou Teu”, “Teu Santo Nome”, “Gratidão”, entre outras. O DVD contou também com as participações de Fernandinho (“Creio em Ti”), Felippe Valadão (""Pra Onde Iremos”) e Leonardo Gonçalves (""Nossa Canção”).

Em 2017 foi gravado o 'EP CÉU' com 5 novas músicas impactantes, com lançamento previsto para Dezembro de 2017. Ela acaba de se associar ao selo Onimusic, veja mais sobre o selo e sua filosofia de trabalho em www.onimusic.com.br   

Toda sua carreira tem sido pautada em conhecer a Jesus e faze-lo conhecido, ""porque dEle, por Ele e para Ele são todas as coisas""

Hip-hop/urban soul supergroup Lucy Pearl was formed in the summer of 1999 as the brainchild of Tony! Toni! Toné multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Raphael Saadiq (formerly known as Raphael Wiggins), who left the band he co-founded with his brother D'Wayne in 1998. Saadiq first contacted DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, which had disbanded after their 1998 LP The Love Movement, and then ex-En Vogue member Dawn Robinson, who had originally departed that group for a solo career in 1997 but jumped at the chance to work with Saadiq and Muhammad. Relying a great deal on live instrumentation in addition to samples and turntable work (Muhammad even plays bass and guitar), Lucy Pearl issued its self-titled debut album in the spring of 2000.",355,248,0,1,9048,2011-07-14 22:35:10,0,"Lucy Pearl, Q-Tip, Snoop Dogg, You, neo-soul, Raphael Saadiq, Dawn Robinson, Beyond Records, R&B, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Tony Toni Toné, Tribe Called Quest, Music Video, lucy pearl you, lucy pearl q tip snoop dogg, snoop dogg lucy pearl, q tip lucy pearl, snoop dogg you, q tip you",Lucy Pearl - You (feat.

【Q;indivi（キュー・インディヴィ）プロフィール】
数多くのTVCM・映像の音楽プロデュースを手掛ける、Q.,Ltd主宰によるクリエイター集団として活動を開始。 資生堂TSUBAKI、GREE、TOYOTAなどで起用された様々なプロデュース楽曲は多方面からの注目を集める。固定のメンバーを持たず、透明感かつ先進感のあるハイブリッドサウンドが特徴であり、映像を喚起させる作品を発表している。 スピンオフとしてRin Oikawaの声に特化した「Q;indivi Starring Rin Oikawa」名義の『Celebration』 シリーズはiTunes総合チャート１位を獲得、ロングセラーを記録。ワーナーミュージックジャパン「unBORDE」では新たなプロダクト「Q;indivi+」としての作品を発表するなど、そのプロデュースワークは多岐に渡る。
 
【Rin Oikawa】
Q;indiviでのメインボーカリストとしての活動をはじめ、数多くの映画作品、菅野よう子作品などのサントラ、CMなどで起用された独特の透明感溢れる歌声が話題を集める。「下妻物語」「嫌われ松子の一生」「パコと魔法の絵本」などに参加、業界内にとどまらずそのネイティブの英語発音と透明感のある歌声は高い注目と評価を集める。2013年にはlivetune作品にfukase(SEKAI NO OWARI)　らと共にゲストボーカルとして参加。ジャンルを超えた活動が大きな注目を集める。

AGARRA Q'É LADRÃO, QUE ELE É FUGITIVO 
GUARDA O TEU TOSTÃO JÁ NÃO DÁ PRA SER BANDIDO
HÁ QUEM SEJA MAIS, VE POR ONDE VAIS.

24 horas por dia no gamanço, 
não me venhas com falinhas de galinhas que na minha mesa eu quero o ganço
que eu acabo sempre teso por ser tanço
e se a cena der pro torto eu chibo o próximo, nada a ver com o malabanço
tudo porque agora só mando tag's, não tenho um nome completo
agora só mando swag, porque ontem liguei a net
é porque eu sou bueda mau, e tenho o 5º incompleto
e eu não preciso de escola, mas eu nem sei o alfabeto
vivo à dois dias desta maneira
e as fofas acham-me um génio porque eu roubei uma carteira
não sou ladrão de primeira, sou ladrão pra mandar pausa
tenni por cima da meia, meia por cima da calça
é uma postura que é feia mas elas dizem que arrasa
só não te mostro o canivete porque o deixei em casa pra cortar pao
tenho um caparrão, mas sou uma criança
mas não faz mal, levem-me preso, o meu pai paga a fiança
no colégio fui gozado, eu tava pronto pra matança
já passei pela tempestade, agora quero a bonança
sem confiança, não me olhes de lado rapaz
que eu sou um perigo pra quem tem de um metro e meio pra baixo
sempre tive sorte com a vida, o meu pai tem bueda guita
mas eu quero ser um bandido perspicaz
eu nem sei ser ordinário, mas viro o cap ao contrário
sou um otário mas meu puto tanto faz.


não sou só virgem de signo, mas sou o único que sei
peço 10 euros ao cota, na zona eu digo que roubei
não devo nada a ninguém, não devo mas temo
... o meu nome agora é André pequeno
sou mau à defesa, pior ainda no contra-ataque 
não sei o que ele diz, mas boy eu curto bue de 2pac
sou mais um puto mimado, porque a mamã só me impede
mas mesmo assim eu ainda acho que sou dread


AGARRA Q'É LADRÃO
nunca descobri o que isso é, mas mesmo assim eu vou gritando vida louca
AGARRA Q'É LADRÃO
vivo a contar com as companhias, talvez um dia leve um pezão na boca
AGARRA Q'É LADRÃO
sou mais um bandido que vem por moda, e pela moda eu passo a vida a imitar
AGARRA Q'É LADRÃO
mas como o papá tá pra falir, talvez um dia eu possa vir a precisar",299,246,0,1,11602,2013-12-26 00:43:45,0,"Madorna, m75, zeca, dillaz, agarra qé ladrao",Dillaz - Agarra Q'é Ladrão,fsxWWNRtiDE,2395129,CPQDEAA,q,0,13,12,26,360,3,6.379328909182495,2.808885867359812,4.064532861131578,2.4756711883244296,6,52,0.0,394,0.0,4,0.0,4,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,26,0.6371411349054339,0.4403105573247153,1.6417902669386857,0,0,1.0

Lyrics:

I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying """"damn"""" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

Cuz when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)""",18751,324,0,1,343196,2009-10-25 07:10:24,1,"R Kelly, When A Woman's Fed Up, Rkellyvevo, When A Woman's Fed Up Live, vevo, RKellyVEVO, acoustic, video, music, instrumental, Bump And Grind, When A Womans Fed Up, Ignition, Trapped In The Closet 1-12, official, remix, audio, download, When A Woman's Fed Up Lyrics, contemporary r and b, karaoke, Step In The Name Of Love, lyrics, official video, cover, I Wish, Sony, music video, playlist, When A Woman's Fed Up Official Video, single, album",R.

Video by Jeroen Mylle and Fabrice Parent - Maanlander  http://www.maanlander.eu/

""Rheia"" is the groundbreaking album from Belgium's Oathbreaker. Engineered, mixed, and mastered by Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Loma Prieta), ""Rheia"" is a true game changer for the genre. Blurring lines and dissolving the boundaries of heavy music as we know it today.

Opener ""10:56"" begins with a haunting guitar riff and Caro Tanghe's beautifully sung vocal before abruptly soaring to new heights with ""Second Son of R"". Its blasts of melody mutate into a blackened buzz while waves of tempo changes pound down with intense emotional weight. ""Being Able To Feel Nothing"" then rolls in like a storm. Chaotically breaking apart to reveal the eye before churning once again. ""Stay Here / Accroche-Moi"" is an otherworldly reverb drenched acoustic number that leads to ""Needles In Your Skin"". A deeply personal song that showcases the artistic strength vulnerability brings. It's hard to believe that this is just the half way point of this post everything masterwork. ""Immortals"" then unfurls as a goose bump inducing monster. This leads to the ambitious ""I'm Sorry, This Is"", ""Where I Live"", and ""Where I Leave”; A musical triptych that needs to be heard to be believed. All of it comes to an end with mesmerizing closer ""Begeerte"". Ethereally materializing before vanishing into the beautiful unknown.",190,495,0,1,7243,2016-08-18 17:10:45,0,"deafheaven, neurosis, converge, trap them, black metal, metal, hardcore, alternative","Oathbreaker ""10:56"" / ""Second Son of R.""

Connect-R - Vinovat (Special Guest Misha) | VERSURI

Tu sa nu plângi ca nu plec nicăieri 
Pentru mine mâine va fi ieri 
De-ți va lipsi ceva te rog sa-mi ceri 
Dar sa nu-mi ceri sa stau ca nu mai am puteri 

Super eroul tău, recunoaște ca e laș
El nu mai zboară face pași 
Și pașii tai sa ii opresti ca sa ma lași ca eu te las 
Ca cel mai bun e-un bun rămas 

Fiindcă eu știu cât am încercat 
Am crezut ca te-am iertat , dar n-am uitat 
Și jur crede-ma am încercat 
Din vina ta ma simt eu vinovat 

Haide spune-mi cum sa iert 
Fiindcă nu vreu sa te pierd
Însă eu știu cât am încercat 
Am crezut ca te-am iertat, dar n-am uitat

Nu ma cunoști dar tu pretinzi ca ma 
Lasă orgoliul meu acolo nu sunt eu  
Acuma cheamă-ma 
Nu e nimeni mai aproape de tine 
Ca tine cine sa spună mai bine iartă ma 
Atatea vise mari acuma mi se par 
Ca sunt toate un coșmar 
Fiindcă lumea mea e-o gheara de fiara când tu n-apari 

Super eroul tău, recunoaște ca e laș 
El nu mai zboară face pași 
Și pașii tai sa ii opresti ca sa ma lași ca eu te las 
Ca cel mai bun e-un bun rămas 

Fiindcă eu știu cât am încercat 
Am crezut ca te-am iertat, dar n-am uitat 
Și jur crede-ma am încercat 
Din vina ta ma simt eu vinovat 

Hai învață-ma sa iert 
Fiindcă nu vreau sa te pierd 
Însă eu știu cât am încercat 
Am crezut ca te-am iertat, dar n-am uitat!",1257,203,0,0,27481,2018-05-22 12:57:16,0,"connect-r, vinovat, official, video, videoclip, oficial, connectr, connecter, single oficial, piesa, oficiala, muzica, romaneasca, pop, artist, vara nu dorm, tren de noapte, baga mare, dragostit, connect-r feat andra, semne, noi ne potrivim, hituri romanesti, rappin on production, officialconnectr, connect-r oficial, canal oficial connect-r, romanian top hits, top radio hits romania, connect-r official, summer hits romania 2018, conncert-r misha",Connect-R - Vinovat (Special Guest Misha) | Official Video,mLPTlJYktfc,3158804,CGQQAA,r,0,18,5,22,142,1,6.499522679289369,2.8369567370595505,4.439032532120414,3.0993352776859577,6,21,0.1726190476190476,363,0.30952380952380953,31,0.35714285714285715,8,0,4,0,3,1,4,2,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,3,3,1,0,0,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,58,0.6829782356580311,0.4364869355867424,1.4322530911966087,0,0,1.0

Girl I must have been crazy 
To say that it was over
I had to be a fool 
To yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone 
And feeling down and out baby
When I never 
Meant for this to end
It was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe

Tôi Đã Quên Thật Rồi Lyrics:
VER1
Tôi đã quen sáng đêm 1 mình
Tôi đã quen thấy trên màn hình
Điện thoại vẫn cứ báo vang tin nhắn chờ
Anh gì ơi giờ khuya thế này
Anh gì ơi tại sao lúc này anh chưa có ai cùng nắm tay?

Giết thời gian lướt trên điện thoại
Tim còn mang những ưu phiền hoài
Màn hình thắp sáng thói quen nơi cuối ngày
Ai còn đang cùng tôi lúc này
Ai còn đang bận tâm mỗi ngày, đôi mắt vẫn chưa thể nhắm lại.

Chuyện buồn mà tôi không nói
Em chia tay tôi mất rồi
Chắc chắn sẽ không gặp nữa
Từng lời hứa mai sau chẳng còn nữa

CHORUS:
Tôi quên đi thật rồi
Tôi quên luôn cái tên đã làm tôi yêu thương suốt 1 thời
Quên luôn đi những môi hôn
Bao lần tôi đã trao
Và tôi ước ao ngay ngày mai, có ai bên cạnh

Tôi quên đi thật rồi
Tôi quên luôn nhắn tin cho người tôi yêu thương suốt 1 thời
Hôm nay tôi nhớ ai đây
Chẳng còn ai muốn yêu
Còn ai nhắn tin khi về đêm
Babe babe tôi đã quên thật rồi...

VER2
Tôi đã quen sáng đêm 1 mình
Tôi đã quen thấy trên màn hình
Điện thoại vẫn cứ báo vang tin nhắn chờ
Anh gì ơi ngủ đi tối rồi
Anh đừng lo rồi sẽ có người cùng anh nắm tay cùng sánh vai

Chuyện buồn mà tôi không nói
Em chia tay tôi mất rồi
Có lẽ sẽ không gặp nữa
Từng lời hứa mai sau chẳng còn nữa

CHORUS:
Tôi quên đi thật rồi
Tôi quên luôn cái tên đã làm tôi yêu thương suốt 1 thời
Quên luôn đi những môi hôn

Tôi quên đi thật rồi

Lyrics:

I'm a gigolo, spending lot's a dough
You can tell the way wide-body, sitting on four's
And how I'm shining, wit thefresh, fresh clothes
Always surrounded, by so many (HOES!)
I'm a gigolo, always on the go
Everytime I turn around, I got another show
In the club, hit about three in a row
Drop in the Six, 'cause I love them (HO!)

Shorty I, only got one night in town, tell me baby where you down
Bushes we won't beat around, bushes we just eat 'em now
Feeling yo Masqueno blouse, seven jean, Black and Lebanese
Head to her knees, please if you ever need a bachelor remember me
Just rock to the melody, I got you in bed wit me
I thought you would never leave
You wanna name meLike A-merie
Know the chain freeze wrist be the same degrees

Drop top head shot when your roof down

That's a tre pound 
And now your thinking that you should have never came out 

12 gauge dot dot chat shit get shot 
This spot got hot gotta change house 
Catting for a hot wok or a steak house 
And if my nigga don't eat I'ma spray rounds 

And if my nigga got beef then it's my war 
How many niggas in your set would you die for?
And if your nigga got shot would you shoot back
You got a gun but you dunno how to use that 

Mind how you talk on the phone 
Ma 2 pit bulls walk around on their own 
It's best that you leave me alone 
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone 

Chief Keef

You got a trap but don’t know how to get it jumping 
You in a fast car but don’t know how to push it 
I’m in a fast car getting T like I’m Pusha
You say you’re a killer but now we gotta push it 
2 30s under the T like I’m Booker. 
Slide on you late night like a hooker 
Send my young boys to smoke you like a hooker 
They gon think that he a chef when he cook you 
Pick a chopstick up and chop you like a butcher 
Take the magazine I’m a plug it like it’s hook though 
You be shooting in the air like yo she look dope 
Let it go till there ain’t no more like man she book though

Skengdo

They're like Skeng you better calm down 
You're gonna end up locked or rotting in the ground 
But you know I can’t stop gotta make the pounds 
Old skl out the window wouldn’t make a sound 
Hella man chatty yeah they're bitches 
The bitch is telling me I should do kisses 
She mything only the cash I be lipsing 
The big ting she shoves in it her mouth she ain’t thinking 
Their man there fear the kitchen but that’s cool cah the corn game is different 
You don’t wanna see my dargs when they risen 
You don’t wanna see my dargs when they risen

AM 

Give me one chance 
Give me one chance

Need a big red bone what the bumbaclart 
Home time if she can't hold fire arms 

I don't fuck with a bitch if that. Bitch is lame

0,LordeVEVO,950,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"The music on Lorde's 'Melodrama' reflects the wealth of emotions the New Zealand native has experienced of late, and they’re rendered with the kind of poise we’ve come to expect from the pop superstar. Her voice, the melodies, the arrangements she’s chosen to help landscape her feelings - this critically-acclaimed second album is particularly fetching because the 20-year-old singer trusts her idiosyncrasies to fuel her eloquence. “Let’s let things come out of the woodwork,” she coos on “Homemade Dynamite.” That’s what makes the six performances of ‘Vevo X Lorde’ so powerful as well. All her best ideas naturally seep to the surface. Filmed at Electric Lady Sound Studios in New York’s West Village, the mid-August session found Lorde moving through key songs from ‘Melodrama,’ providing each with the proper temperament for the occasion. The set list features “The Louvre,” “Sober,” “Writer In The Dark,” “Supercut,” “Homemade Dynamite,” and “Hard Feelings”/ “Loveless” – she chose to spotlight some of the album’s most vivid moments. Whether backed by a small ensemble, playing the piano alone, or singing a cappella with a squad of vocalists and a beatbox, she brings invention and intensity to the performances. The soft addition of strings and brass adds to the show’s intimacy, and the drama that she’s built a rep on is central to every moment. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, who produced and co-wrote parts of ‘Melodrama,’ arrives on “Writer In The Dark” to support his pal as well.

Lyrics:

When I meet you in my dreams 
The stars are about to shine 
Looking for creativity 
The memory's so divine 
So baby, come, be close to me 
Together we can run 
To heaven, to the melodies 
Always with you my hun 

You are my diamond 
Light of my sun 
Spilled ink 
Blue mirror 
Not gold and fashion 
Just come, be with me 
My color noir 
Don't tell me, don't tell me 
That you have forgot (me) 

I'm Looking at the photographs 
Smoking weed, drinking wine 
We were so healthy, young and rich 
And you were only mine 
So baby come hug me in bed 
Like you did in the past 
I promise to make no mistakes 
Our love will always last 

You are my diamond 
Light of my sun 
Spilled ink 
Blue mirror 
Not gold and fashion 
Just come, be with me 
My color noir 
Don't tell me, don't tell me 
That you have forgot (me) 

I'm Wearing my very old dress, 
Tiara and brown shoes 
I Have all of these diamond rings 
But I do not have you 
I'll give up on all of my money 
Just for one last goodbye 
The theory doesn't matter baby 
You have already died 

You are my diamond 
Light of my sun 
Spilled ink 
Blue mirror 
Not gold and fashion 
Just come, be with me 
My color noir 
Don't tell me, don't tell me 
That you have forgot (me)

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all

Lyrics:
verse:

i used to love these sheets
dark hair against the white
i miss watching you get dressed
in our hazy bedroom light

it took a couple weeks
last night i finally cried
i remembered us in london
your chocolate covered eyes

pre:

sick of staring up at the ceiling
how’d you change your mind just like that
the only way to get past this feeling
is to tell myself you’re not coming back

chorus:

i don’t wanna love you anymore
i don’t wanna love you anymore
from the start i never thought i’d say this before
but i don’t wanna love you anymore

verse:

you got that letter framed
is it still up on that shelf
it’s the one i left on our bed
when you were out of town

pre:

sick of staring up at the ceiling
how’d you change your mind just like that
the only way to get past this feeling
is to tell myself you’re not coming back

chorus:

i don’t wanna love you anymore
i don’t wanna love you anymore
from the start i never thought i’d say this before
but i don’t wanna love you anymore

i don’t wanna love you anymore
i don’t wanna love you anymore
i can’t forget the way it felt when you walked out the door
so i don’t wanna love you anymore

bridge:

sometimes i just wanna talk for a minute
but i can’t bring myself to call
because i know that your heart’s not really in it and
whatever we had is gone

chorus:

i don’t wanna love you anymore
i don’t wanna love you anymore
from the start i never thought i’d say this before
but i don’t wanna love you anymore

i don’t wanna love you anymore
i don’t wanna love you anymore
i can’t forget the way it felt when you walked out the door
so i don’t wanna love you anymore

Lyrics:

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

Brett Young, ""In Case You Didn't Know"" Lyrics: 

“I can’t count the times I almost said what’s on my mind / But I didn’t / Just the other day I wrote down all the things I’d say / But I couldn’t, just couldn’t / Baby I know that you’ve been wondering / Mmm, so here goes nothing.”

Chorus:
“In case you didn’t know / Baby I’m crazy ’bout you / And I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you / Even though I don’t tell you all the time / You had my heart a long, long time ago / In case you didn’t know.”

“The way you look tonight, that second glass of wine / That did it, mmm / There was something ’bout that kiss, girl it did me in / Got me thinking / I’m thinking / One of the things that I’ve been feeling / Mmm it’s time you here ’em.”

Lyrics:

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

When a rich nigga want you
And yournigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal

Lyrics:

Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colours for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me...
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you.

LYRICS
I don't mind letting you down easy
But just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while

You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone

Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well you can ring anybody's bell to get what you want

See it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone

Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun living in the real world

Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone

Ain't it fun living in the real world
(Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone

I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

What the hell's going on around here?

First off-let's take it from the start
Straight out-can't change what's in my heart
No one-can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me

You ain't-never seen no one like me
Prevail-regardless what the cost might be
Power-flows inside of me, you can't bring me

Never-fall as long as I try
Refuse-to be a part of your lie
Even-if it means I die, you can't bring me

I guess it's just another one of those nights 
When I'll spend way too much time 
On something so small that no one really cares about at all 
I guess it's just another one of those thoughts 
And I can't really find a cause 
Whether it's all just in my mind or something more here in my life 

It's u, it's u 
Oh god, it's u 
It's u 
If you're awake then I am too 
If you're lost then I'll find you 
If you're hurt then I'll fix you 
If you go blind I'll describe the view 
If you can't feel then I'll hold you 
If you fall know I've got you 

And if you fall down too far and I can't see you through these marks 
And your eyes are covered in scars, and my head's filling with tar 
Don't worry we'll find another way out 

Your silhouette doesn't look quite right 
And I can never find the time 
To bury my hands in words 
I'd grow a new kind of evergreen tree, just for you and me 
On second thoughts, will you even remember me? 

But it's always been u (It's always been u) 
It's always been u (It's always been u) 
It's always been u (It's always been u) 
It's always been u (It's always been u) 
It's always been u (It's always been u) 
It's always been u 
Is it me for u?

Composição: Gaab/Rodriguinho/Thomaz/Stefan

Letra:
Quer mudar o jogo? Viver outra vida?
Quer fazer as coisas que ninguém jamais faria?
Mude sua rotina, sua companhia
Se depender delas, você sabe, tá fodida, ei

Fala menos, senta mais
Pensa menos, faça mais
Sei que é ruim se arriscar
Mas no fim é bom demais
Fala menos, senta mais
Pensa menos, faça mais
Sei que é ruim se arriscar
Mas no fim é bom demais

Pode até parecer que é coisa louca
Mas você sabe, dá água na boca
A noite pode virar dia
A noite pode virar dia
Me dando o que cê nunca deu
Esquece tudo o que aprendeu
Me diz depois se não valeu

Essas menina de hoje em dia cheia de hipocrisia
Se faz de santinha, mas na cama é uma vadia
Quer tapa na bunda pra realçar a marquinha
Quer levar a amiga pra ela não ficar sozinha
Amiga que é amiga divide com a amiga
E eu fornecendo tudo que ela precisa
E eu fornecendo tudo que ela precisa

Eu não sou loiro e nem tenho o olho azul
(Não não) oh, (não, não), oh (não, não)
Mas quando eu pego, eu vou falar pra tu
(Não,, não) oh, (não, não), oh (não não)
Eu gosto tanto de um corpinho nu
Oh, oh
Amor à primeira vista, I love you
Yeah, I love you

Te ter pra mim é sonho de criança
Eu amo quando sua bunda balança
Quando me faz carinho enquanto a gente transa
A mais danada que tem carinha de santa
O que você quer? Onde você tá?
O que você tem? Posso te ajudar
Calma, fica bem, deixe isso pra lá
A vida é uma só, tem que aproveitar

Não é que eu faço isso com um monte
Você sabe, você tem o seu lugar
Conversamos sobre isso ontem
Sério que quer discutir ao invés de transar?

Oh, oh, oh
Mas quando eu pego, eu vou falar pra tu
Oh, oh
Eu gosto tanto de um corpinho nu
Oh, oh
Amor à primeira vista, I love you

Eu fico só olhando a molecada de hoje em dia
Falar de praticar, mas nem saíram da teoria
Falando que se pegam, sempre faz e acontece
Mentindo fácil assim ninguém merece
Sempre falei com o Gaab pra colar com quem sabe
E liberei segredos guardado a sete chaves
Pegada que passa de geração em geração
E todas que sentirem vão comer na sua mão
E todas que sentirem vão comer na sua mão
Vem!
Finge que me engana que finjo que eu sou enganado
Diz que me ama, que sou seu namorado
Se tá na cama, o jogo tá armado
Eu sempre ganho, no máximo eu deixo empatado

Oh, oh, oh
Mas quando eu pego, eu vou falar pra tu
Oh, oh
Eu gosto tanto de um corpinho nu
Oh, oh
Amor à primeira vista, I love you

防弾少年団が三枚目のミニアルバム『花様年華pt.1』でカムバックした。
ただの少年ではない、少しずつ成長していく防弾少年団に会うことができるアルバム。
各トラックごとに叙情的でポップ的な感じが溶け込んで、
音楽的に大小の変化を感じることができる。

タイトル曲の「I NEED U」は、アーバンスタイルが融合したエレクトロヒップホップ曲。
叙情性が加味された東洋的なメインテーマとワイルドなヒップホップが融合された歌。
サウンド的にエレクトリックソースを使用して防弾少年団の過去の音楽とはまた違った感じを与える。
「I NEED U」は、終わりに向かって墜落する愛を止めようとする切ない気持ちを表現している。

방탄소년단이 세 번째 미니앨범 [화양연화 pt.1]으로 돌아왔다. 이젠 마냥 어리기만 한 소년이 아닌, 조금씩 성장하고 있는 방탄소년단을 만날 수 있는 음반이다. 각 트랙마다 서정적이고 팝적인 느낌이 녹아있어, 음악적으로 크고 작은 변화를 느낄 수 있다.

타이틀곡인 ‘I NEED U’는 어반 스타일이 접목된 일렉트로 힙합곡이다. 서정성이 가미된 동양적인 메인 테마와 와일드한 힙합이 결합된 노래다. 사운드적으로 일렉트릭 소스를 사용해 방탄소년단의 지난 음악과는 또 다른 느낌으로 다가온다. ‘I NEED U’에는 끝을 향해 추락하는 사랑을 붙잡아 보려는 애타는 마음이 담겨있다.",33471,220,0,0,1877656,2015-04-29 15:00:01,0,"원더케이, 1theK, 로엔, 로엔티비, 로엔뮤직, loen, loentv, loenmusic, 韓流, 韓国, kpop, artist, mv, teaser, 뮤비, 티져, ロエン, ミュージック, テレビ, ミュージックビデオ, ティーザー, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, エスエフ, シー・エス・アイ, ２４時間前, レッツダンス, 踊り, ダンス, 振付け, インタビュー, イベント, ラントゥユー, ライブ, new song, 신곡, 방탄소년단, 컴백 트레일러, 빅히트, bts, comeback trailer, big hit, 花樣年華, 화양연화, I NEED U",[MV] BTS(방탄소년단) _ I NEED U,NMdTd9e-LEI,154626270,CDIQAA,u,0,15,4,29,119,2,8.189283279665322,4.914919365427831,6.2736160293644545,4.524668687798298,8,18,0.12904040404040404,251,0.06818181818181818,45,0.0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,0.7660763237904312,0.6001647760350394,1.3865360012507777,0,0,1.0

[Step2/4] has got the complimentary reviews from both the public and the critics. IN the album [Talk about S], she talks about confident woman. Now she is coming back to us with the third solo album [Truth or Dare]. Here, she talks about truth and rumors. 

The pre-opening song 'Fxxk U' is a song made by Kimena and Lee min-soo who made songs like 'Bloom' and 'Irreversible'. It is a song that has classical guitar sound and has great tempo as well. It is an R&B song where it describes the feelings that everyone feels once in a while. Gain got rid of implicit taboos one by one, and 'Fxxk U' talks about the message of inner side that no female singer has shown before. The title song 'Truth or Dare' and the songs in the album will she released on February 6th, at 0'oclock.

大衆と評論家の好評を同時にもたらした『Step 2/4』、率直で堂々とした主体的な女性像を描いた『Talk about S』に続き、真実と噂について話すガインの３枚目のソロアルバム『Truth or Dare』。

先行公開曲「Fxxk U」は、「取り戻せない」、「咲く」のキム・イナ－イ•ミンスコンビが新たに披露する簡潔な形式のクラシックギター演奏が引き立つテンポ感のあるR＆B系の曲。誰もが一度は感じるようになる率直な感情を飾り気なく単刀直入に表現した。女性アーティストが超えることができなかった暗黙のタブーを一つずつ消してきたガインの「Fxxk U」は、今までどの女性歌手も素直に表現できなかった内面のメッセージを強烈に伝えて、もう一つのタブーを乗り越えている。
タイトル曲「真実あるいは大胆」とアルバム全体の収録曲の公開は2月6日0時に行われる予定である。

대중과 평단의 호평을 동시에 이끌어낸 [Step 2/4], 솔직하고 당당한 주체적인 여성상을 그린 [Talk about S]에 이어 진실과 소문에 대해 이야기 하는 가인의 세 번째 솔로 앨범 [Truth or Dare].

선공개곡 [Fxxk U]는 [돌이킬 수 없는], [피어나]의 김이나-이민수 콤비가 새로이 선보이는 간결한 형식의 클래식 기타 연주가 돋보이는 템포감 있는 R&B 계열의 곡으로, 누구나 한번쯤은 느끼게 되는 솔직한 감정을 가식 없이 단도직입적으로 표현했다. 여성 아티스트가 넘을 수 없었던 암묵적인 금기들을 하나씩 지워온 가인의 'Fxxk U'는 지금껏 그 어떤 여가수도 솔직하게 표현하지 못했던 내면의 메시지를 강렬하게 전달하며 또 하나의 금기를 넘어선다.

청하 3rd Mini Album [Blooming Blue]

‘Why Don’t You Know’, ‘Roller Coaster’로 연이어 음원 차트 상위권에 안착, 롱런을 기록하며 솔로 데뷔 이래 꾸준하게 상승 곡선으로 커리어를 그려내고 있는 청하, 이제는 유망주에서 차세대 솔로 아티스트임을 증명한 청하가 세 번째 미니 앨범 ‘Blooming Blue’로 돌아왔다. 제목이 암시하듯 이번 앨범은 활짝 피어나 짙어진 푸른색처럼 더욱 성장한 청하의 자신감을 엿볼 수 있다. 타이틀곡 ‘Love U’는 데뷔곡 ‘Why Don’t You Know’의 프로듀싱 팀 오레오의 작품으로 청량한 트로피컬 사운드를 기반으로 펼쳐지는 아름다운 멜로디 그리고 더욱 견고해진 청하의 목소리를 더해 전작을 잇는 완벽한 여름날의 찬가가 완성되었다.


[ALBUM REVIEW]

02. Love U
타이틀곡 ‘Love U’는 데뷔곡 ‘Why Don’t You Know’의 프로듀싱 팀 오레오의 작품이다. 이번 곡은 각 파트마다 입체적으로 변화되는 편곡이 인상적인데, 그루비 한 뭄바톤 리듬에서 시작하여 후반부 일렉트로닉 사운드까지 다양한 음악적 아이디어가 촘촘하게 배치되어 곡을 듣는 재미를 더한다. 파워풀한 브라스 섹션, 청량한 트로피컬 사운드를 기반으로 펼쳐지는 아름다운 멜로디 그리고 견고해진 청하의 목소리를 더해 전작을 잇는 완벽한 여름날의 찬가가 완성되었다.

Lyrics:
My life is a movie
And everyone’s watching 
So let’s get to the good part 
And passed all the non-sense 

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening 
It’s like they want me to be perfect 
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting 
Cause life’s not easy 
I’m not made out of steel 
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you 
I’ll show you 
I’ll show you 

I’ve got to learn things 
Learn them the hard way 
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say 

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening 
It’s like they want me to be perfect 
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting 
Cause life’s not easy 
I’m not made out of steel 
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you 
I’ll show you 
I’ll show you 

Cause life’s not easy 
I’m not made out of steel 
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real 
Act like you know me, but you never will 
There’s one thing I know for sure

Lifted from ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" film, this video is actually comprised of two songs: ""The Happiest Days Of Our Lives"" and ""Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2"" This video became the official video of ""Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2"" after the release of the film in 1982.

This single is by far Pink Floyd's greatest ever mainstream success, instantly attaining classic status, and is perhaps their most famous piece of work. 

ABINTW Pt. 2 even became the protest song of a group of South African students during the apartheid regime, the song was subsequently banned in South Africa. 

The song itself is a protest against the rigidity of British schools, and in particular, the boarding school system Waters would have been part of as a young boy.

The poem read out by the schoolteacher is a direct reference to ""Money""

The schoolteacher in this video was portrayed by the late, great, Scottish actor Alex McAvoy who passed away in June 2005.

I ain't no hat or nothing 
But he can't love you like I can 
Trust me 

Ooh, ooh, ooh 

As the clock strikes twelve 
I'm sitting here wondering how the hell 
Did I let you leave 
And baby I know that I did my share 
Of things to deceive you 
I'm just trying to get an understanding 
Of what to do 
Cause I'm half way going crazy 
Girl they can't fade me 

He can't love you like I love you 
Baby you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man

baby it´s so real to me
now that it´s over 
the space where you used to be 
your head on my shoulder 
 
all of the plans we made
that never happened
now your scent on my pillow´s faded
at least you left me with something
 
there´s this empty space you left behind 
now you´re not here with me 
i keep digging through our waste of time 
but the pictures incomplete
cause i´m missing you 
i miss u 
 
can´t make sense of all of the pieces 
of my own delusions 
can´t take all these memories
don´t know how to use them 
 
there´s a slick washed up onto the beach
i follow the traces 
finding clues in my pockets and 
opening boxes and 
going places we went 
remember to forget 
thinking how it could been
everything´s transparent and
i´ve turned all my sorrow into glass
it don´t leave no shadow 
 
there´s this empty space you left behind 
now you´re not here with me 
i keep digging through our waste of time
but the pictures incomplete 
 
cause i´m missing you
i miss u
 
this part of you
this clock that stopped 
this residue
it´s all i´ve got
 
this part of you 
this clock that stopped
this residue
it´s all i´ve got 
 
There’s this empty space you left behind
I keep thinking you’re still right beside me 
There’s this empty space you left behind
Oooh baby all the love you gave it still defines me 
 
There’s this empty space you left behind
I keep thinking you’re still right beside me
There’s this empty space you left behind
all the love you gave it still defines me

Lyrics:

Cause when I'm kissing you my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place you're all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I'm kissing you
When I'm kissing you it all starts making sense
And all the questions I've been asking in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""
Crystal clear it becomes when I'm kissing you",2705,197,0,1,90426,2010-03-19 22:09:39,1,"MirandaCosgroveVEVO, acoustic, Miranda Cosgrove Kissin U, music, Kissin U Official Video, kissing you, instrumental, Kissin U Lyrics, disgusting, vevo, Kissin U Live, stay my baby, Miranda Cosgrove Lyrics, official, download, dancing crazy, karaoke, remix, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, Miranda Cosgrove Official, Sony, Miranda Cosgrove Live, music video, playlist, single, album, live, shakespeare, hq, Columbia, Kissin U, Miranda, Pop",Miranda Cosgrove - Kissin U,nhT_6Yz-Nbc,11137569,CPoBEAA,u,0,10,3,19,78,4,7.046790407615205,4.0754009555138975,4.956293320221388,3.4321672694425884,7,11,0.3650793650793651,127,-0.21038961038961035,35,0.0,4,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,27,0.7033405328566754,0.5783343507861057,1.444071028923462,0,1,1.0

`U-Go-Girl`은 티저 영상을 통해 곡의 일부가 이미 공개되었던 곡으로 힙합 비트에 기반을 둔 독특한 스타일의 댄스 곡. 랩(rap)과 송(song)의 중간쯤에 위치해 있는 발랄한 도입구에 이어 이효리 특유의 비음이 매력적인 후렴구가 귀에 쏙 들어온다. 곡의 제목처럼 여성들에게 `수줍어하거나 주저하지 말고 솔직하고 당당하게 마음을 보이라`는 메시지를 전하는 곡으로 이효리의 솔직하고 건강한 매력을 전한다. 신인 작곡가 E-TRIBE의 곡.

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

(ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)

We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell.
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

“Tokyo Bon 2020” is a co-production with the largest influencer marketing company in Japan - Cool Japan TV. The Bon Odori dance is choreographed by the award winner Japanese traditional dancer - Ukon Takafuji. 

The song combines Japan traditional music elements with Asia pop, giving the song dynamic energy that has never been heard before. The song also potrayes the unique and cute sound of Japanglish, the friendship beyond the border, and the love for Japanese cultures.

Bon Odori is a traditional Japanese dance that performed all over Japan with people holding hands together and dancing in a circle. The song contains a wish for world peace where people from different backgrounds hold hands together, and an invitation to the largest festival of peace - “Tokyo Olympics 2020”.

Lyrics:

Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.""",38146,199,0,1,853260,2013-04-05 22:45:52,1,"rocky mountain high, JohnDenvervevo, John Denver lyrics, Country Roads, acoustic, video, thank god ima country boy, music video, music, hq, Country Roads live, single, hd, album, John Denver live, Take Me Home Country Roads, vevo, Country Road, JohnDenverVevo, Poems Prayers and Promises, official, country, greatest hits, download, Take Me Home, remix, lyrics, official video, cover, John Denver Take Me Home, original, Sony, annie's song, on, me","John Denver - Take Me Home, Country Roads (Audio)",1vrEljMfXYo,165660910,CGQQAA,v,0,13,4,5,95,4,8.219220042673596,4.85682552374411,5.931081386806369,4.581449004440182,8,14,0.14119047619047614,153,0.2893831168831169,34,0.0,8,0,2,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,3,5,0,0,2,1,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,49,0.7216112180976568,0.5909107553426995,1.2945863592627946,0,1,1.0

Lyrics:

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say: Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

http://www.facebook.com/9Beethoven
https://twitter.com/YtAndrearomano6

The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯ minor ""Quasi una fantasia"", op. 27, No. 2, by Ludwig van Beethoven

The sonata has three movements:

1 mvt: Adagio sostenuto. 
2 mvt: Allegretto (click to go at 6:00 min).
3 mvt: Presto agitato (click to go at 8:05 min).

Adagio sostenuto

The first movement, in C♯ minor, is written in an approximate truncated sonata form. The movement opens with an octave in the left hand and a triplet figuration in the right. A melody that Hector Berlioz called a ""lamentation"", mostly by the right hand, is played against an accompanying ostinato triplet rhythm, simultaneously played by the right hand. The movement is played pianissimo or ""very quietly"", and the loudest it gets is mezzo forte or ""moderately loud"".

The adagio sostenuto has made a powerful impression on many listeners; for instance, Berlioz said of it that it ""is one of those poems that human language does not know how to qualify. The work was very popular in Beethoven's day, to the point of exasperating the composer himself, who remarked to Carl Czerny, ""Surely I've written better things.


 Allegretto

The second movement is a relatively conventional scherzo and trio, a moment of relative calm written in D-flat major, the enharmonic equivalent of C♯ major, the more easily-notated parallel major of C♯ minor. Franz Liszt described the second movement as ""a flower between two chasms.""[citation needed] The slight majority of the movement is in piano, but a handful of sforzandos and forte-pianos helps to maintain the movement's cheerful disposition.


Presto agitato

The stormy final movement (C♯ minor), in sonata form, is the weightiest of the three, reflecting an experiment of Beethoven's (also carried out in the companion sonata, Opus 27, No. 1 and later on in Opus 101) placement of the most important movement of the sonata last. The writing has many fast arpeggios and strongly accented notes, and an effective performance demands lively and skillful playing.

It is thought that the C-sharp minor sonata, particularly the third movement, was the inspiration for Frédéric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu, which manifests the key relationships of the sonata's three movements.

Of the final movement, Charles Rosen has written ""it is the most unbridled in its representation of emotion. Even today, two hundred years later, its ferocity is astonishing.

Beethoven's heavy use of sforzando notes, together with just a few strategically located fortissimo passages, creates the sense of a very powerful sound in spite of the predominance of piano markings throughout. Within this turbulent sonata-allegro, there are two main themes, with a variety of variation techniques utilized.
Beethoven's pedal mark

At the opening of the work, Beethoven included a written direction that the sustain pedal should be depressed for the entire duration of the first movement. The Italian reads: ""Si deve suonare tutto questo pezzo delicatissimamente e senza sordino"". (""One must play this whole piece [meaning ""movement""] very delicately and without dampers."") The modern piano has a much longer sustain time than the instruments of Beethoven's day, leaving for a rather blurry and dissonant tone.

One option for dealing with this problem is to perform the work on a restored or replicated piano of the kind Beethoven knew. Proponents of historically informed performance using such pianos have found it feasible to perform the work respecting Beethoven's original direction.",21367,900,0,1,838635,2010-12-15 15:44:53,0,"Ludwig Van Beethoven (Author), sonata, Allegro, Classic, Cello, Concerto, Prelude, Baroque, Plays, Orchestra, Violin, Chiaro Di Luna, (FULL), Classical Music, Prelude (music), Symphonie (song), chiaro, Movement, Minor, Mondscheinsonate, Classical, moonlight, Symphony, Ludwig, Piano, Organ, beethoven, luna, 14, No, claro de luna, Piano Sonata (Barraqué), Pianist, piano sonata (composition), Piano Sonata No.14 (Composition)",Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (FULL),4Tr0otuiQuU,114732287,CJYBEAA,v,0,10,12,15,349,2,8.059685650619366,4.942082497124185,5.923572983502409,4.3297435500112345,8,50,0.16407685597984106,556,0.09333333333333332,34,0.35,4,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,35,0.7349632777609878,0.6131855150882216,1.3681117403563172,0,0,1.0

From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 23, 1984

THE SHORT FILM
Director: John Landis
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Thriller"" was the third of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status (i.e.: sales in excess of 30 million) by the RIAA for US sales alone. The ""Thriller"" single reached No. 1 in four countries in 1984, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart as well as charts in Spain, France and Belgium. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Thriller the first album to feature seven Top 10 singles. The Recording Industry Association of America certified ""Thriller"" Gold and Platinum on December 4, 1989. 

The groundbreaking short films for the Thriller album, starting with ""Billie Jean,"" following up with ""Beat It"" and culminating with the epic, nearly 14-minute ""Thriller,"" truly expanded the possibilities of ""music video"" as art form. ""I wanted something that would glue you to the set, something you'd want to watch over and over,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""I wanted to be a pioneer in this relatively new medium and make the best short music movies we could make.""

In the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the ""real"" Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of ""Thriller.""

""""Billie Jean"""" was the first short film made for 'Thriller,' the biggest-selling album of all time.

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 2, 1983

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for """"Billie Jean"""" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""""Billie Jean"""" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

""""[W]hen the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen,"""" director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. """"It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."""" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The """"Billie Jean"""" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked """"Billie Jean"""" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside """"Thriller"""" and """"Beat It.""""

About the album:
AC/DC cracked the seal on the '90s with one of the best riffs of their career. That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.

I mixed these 22 recordings with one purpose only, to share my love of beautiful & soothing female (most of the time) vocals. I did insert some instrumental here and there. I uploaded the video in hd but after using the ""resizing"" option of youtube, it was not anymore and I can't manage to change it back so... increase the volume, close your eyes. It will put you in a trance and keep you there. Enjoy.

Interview de Salvatore Adamo par Olivier Bas, responsable du pôle création du Studio des Variétés depuis 2015.

50 ans de carrière, des centaines de chansons, plus de 100 millions de disques vendus à travers le monde… Des succès à n’en plus compter, mais Salvatore Adamo a toujours préféré les lettres aux chiffres, les notes aux comptes.

แต่มันคงเบาไปไม่ถึงเธอ
หนึ่งคำว่ารักคงปลิวไปตามแรงลมก่อนถึงใจเธอ

แม้มันจะมีอยู่บางครั้ง

Zespół VARIUS MANX wraz z Kasią Stankiewicz zapraszają do posłuchania kolejnego singla będącego kontynuacją promocji wydanej w kwietniu płyty “Ent”. “Kot bez ogona” to mądra i niezwykle urokliwa opowieść o emocjach i budowaniu relacji - także tych trudnych. Tekst utworu jest doskonałą referencją dla całego albumu i raz jeszcze potwierdza dobrze znany fakt - Kasia Stankiewicz pisze z takim samym kunsztem, z jakim swe pisarskie efekty wyśpiewuje. W oczach samej Kasi “Kot...” to przepis na uśmiech: 

""Kot bez ogona"" to piosenka rzec można żartobliwa. Ale czym byłoby życie bez uśmiechu! Słuchajcie “Kota” i uśmiechajcie najwięcej jak się da!”

Muzycznie “Kot bez ogona” jest bardziej dynamiczną kontynuacją tego do czego przyzwyczaił fanów zespół Varius Manx. W tytule utworu kryje się zabawna ciekawostka, o której zapewne nie wszyscy fani zespołu wiedzą! Najpełniej jednak mówi o piosence sam Robert Janson:
""Wśród subtelnych i romantycznych utworów ,,Kot bez ogona” wyróżnia się na płycie dynamicznością i ogromnym ładunkiem pozytywnej energii. Tak myślę. Tworząc go miałem intencje przekazania ludziom dobrej energii i myśli na lato i nie tylko. Bardzo lubię tekst, który Kasia stworzyła do tego utworu i w ten sposób powstała piosenka, która mam nadzieje będzie z przyjemnością słuchana przez odbiorców. Tym bardziej że “Varius Manx” to “Kot bez ogona” !!! :)""

TEKST:
[Zwrotka 1]
Wbijam tam z grubej rury, upijam się, mówię bzdury
I zaraz dostanę mandat, bo warczy ten kundel bury
Funkcjonariusza widzę, co łypie ze suczej fury
Bo widział jak tańczę w kroplach deszczyku z tej rudej chmury
Drga mi grdyka, nie słyszę, bo gra muzyka
Te dziewki ciągną te kreski (nie wspomną o Mazowieckim)
Me serce znów za mną tęskni, bo znowu te lufy łykam
I całe od kul dziurawe i jak Rambo kuśtykam
(W tym mieście) nikt już nie tańczy
(W tym mieście) tango to frykas
Panowie owocowi chcą bananem mango dotykać
Gardło nam usycha po narkotykach
Każdy się z czartem i niefartem i ze szklanką boryka
Biały proch Ci leci na czarne szpilki
Pewnie wciągasz biel, jak kiedyś wciągałaś Big Milki
Jestem tu, powiedzieli mi, że wyszłaś o pierwszej
A twoje usta się błyszczały jak lipcowe czereśnie

[Refren]
Ciebie znowu nie było
Gdybyś nie istniała, miastu by wygodniej się żyło
Jestem tu. Byłem tam. Zresztą w sumie, kto nie był?
Jest tu cała WWA, z wyjątkiem Ciebie
Jestem tu, byłem tam, poszłaś z koleżankami
Na tych nogach, które ja nazywam karabinami
No to marsz, marsz
Marsz, marsz, marsz

[Zwrotka 2]
Szukam cię po shot-barach
Z dziewczynami wyglądacie jakbyście były na Oscarach
Ja i koledzy oświadczymy wam się od zaraz
Choć stanowimy pewnie jakąś bandę ciot dla was
Wiążesz włosy w cebulę
I pewnie świat Cię denerwuje jak Alutka Jędrulę
Pewnie Cię bolą oskrzela, a teraz dymem je czule
Opatuliłaś i zamawiasz sobie wódkę z Redbullem
Latacie po mieście jak Bójka, Bajka, Brawurka
Dźwigając swoje atrybuty: wóda, szampan, bibułka
Dzika jak pustynne kresy, stepy, tajga i dżungla
A twoje rzęsy wobec mężczyzn są jak łańcuch dla kundla
Szukasz zapalniczki, ja bym dał Ci ogień
I nękał wzrokiem jak proboszcz, który gwałci bogiem
No, mon dieu, wciąż kochasz mnie, ja w to nie wątpię
Chociaż w zeszły piątek przecież poszłaś za tamtym Piotrkiem?

[Refren]

[Zwrotka 3]
Lubisz muskulaturę
Gestykulujesz, jakbyś znów zdawała ustna maturę
Gdy ciebie widzę momentalnie zamiast mózgu mam dziurę
Chce z tobą chadzać po knajpach, zamawiać kus-kus na spółę
Potem w nocy się kochać i rano zamawiać pizzę
Bo jesteś fajna i dobra, tylko że w złym towarzystwie
Wolicie koksować w loftach. My raczej browar przy Wiśle
Może cię pojmam i koszmar Ci zrobię, żeby się przyśnić?
Okej, za daleko
Ale chyba się zatrułem znów nóżkami z galaretą
Jutro będzie masa ibupromów, potem kawa, mleko
Ale póki mogę się na nogi dzisiaj stawiam setą
Gorzka ruda chmura znowu kropi
Zastanawiam się co robisz i gdzie teraz stawiasz kroki
I dlaczego mi nie odpisujesz, kurwa, błagam odpisz!
Nagle jesteś, rzucam setką gdzie popadnie, bo nie zdążę jej dopić
No, i
Butla się tłucze o chodnik
Idzie jakaś para do taksówki, chyba to Grosik
A ty drąc się w niebo głosy do chłopaka podchodzisz
I krzyczysz coś, co sugeruje, że się znacie z przeszłości
Ile minęło sekund? No, maks trzy
On bierze tamtą drugą i ją rzuca do taksy
To jest jest ten cały Piotr? Kurwa mać, jestem tak zły
Rzuciłbym butem w Ciebie gdyby to nie były air maxy

W ramach projektu weterani rapu połączyli siły z reprezentantami nowej szkoły, reinterpretując wzajemnie jedne z najważniejszych numerów w swoim dorobku. Zobaczcie pierwszy efekt tej współpracy – klip do „Chcemy Być Wyżej” Sokoła, utworu oryginalnie nagranego przez Sitka.

ALBUM DOSTĘPNY W SKLEPACH W CAŁYM KRAJU



Biuro Ochrony Rapu Records, unhuman.pl, Diil Gang, oraz Agencja Bashesh z dumą prezentują oficjalny odsłuch albumu Palucha ""Lepszego Życia Diler"". 



""Lepszego Życia Diler"" to album przesiąknięty życiowymi tematami, które ubrane w słowa pozbawione zbędnej kalkulacji, podkreślą niezależność Palucha zarówno w życiu osobistym, jak i na rapowej scenie. Idealnie trafiające w czułe punkty otaczającej nas rzeczywistości wersy opisują ją dogłębnie i dosadnie, bez cukru i zbędnej polityki.
Jeśli oczekujesz zabawnych ""bangerów"", to ten album nie jest dla Ciebie.

Kolejny raz Paluch zgrabnie miesza syntetyczne bity z wartościową treścią, dając odbiorcy ponadczasowy mix, którego nikt wcześniej nie proponował. Oczywiście nie zabraknie klasycznych produkcji, które świetnie komponują się z całością a jednocześnie subtelnie załamują klimat w czasie odsłuchu krążka.

Materiał trafi na sklepowe półki 20 grudnia 2013r nakładem Biuro Ochrony Rapu Records.

""Lepszego Życia Diler"" to 7 solowy krążek poznańskiego rapera, który na scenie obecny jest od 2004r.

Po wielkim sukcesie albumu Stanisławy Celińskiej „Atramentowa"" postanowiliśmy oddać w Państwa ręce nowe, wyjątkowe wydawnictwo, zawierające 9 premierowych nagrań, które są jednocześnie dopełnieniem ostatniej, już platynowej płyty.

„Atramentowa...Suplement"" zawiera niezwykle klimatyczne utwory, zmysłowo – jak zawsze – zaśpiewane przez niepowtarzalną Artystkę. Muzykę do tekstów Doroty Czupkiewicz oraz samej Stanisławy Celińskiej skomponował i zaaranżował producent płyty Maciej Muraszko.

Na płycie znalazły się ponadto dwa wspaniałe covery: nowa odsłona jednego z najbardziej znanych utworów z repertuary Czesława Niemena – „Pod papugami"" oraz przebój lat 60-tych – „Manha De Carnaval"" (niezapomniany temat z musicalu „Czarny Orfeusz""), do którego polskie słowa napisała Stanisława Celińska.",118,342,0,1,2062,2015-10-27 13:34:19,0,"polskie, radio, polska, muzyka, piosenki, najnowsze, najlepsze, przeboje, muza, po polsku, music, polski, Stanisława Celińska (Musical Artist), płyta, płyty, polskiego radia, agecnja muzyczna, piosenka aktorska, suplement, W imię miłości, Stanisława Celińska - W imię miłości, Stanisława Celińska W imię miłości",Stanisława Celińska - W imię miłości,ATijKr0MYHM,523332,CJYBEAA,w,0,15,10,27,300,1,5.718777291205405,2.2227164711475837,3.314288660947497,2.071882007306125,5,44,0.0,107,0.0,21,0.0,5,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,6,0,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,36,0.5795449782673581,0.3886698778366097,1.5996512587397569,0,0,1.0

„Trasa koncertowa jest chyba najważniejszym z etapów muzycznej drogi ponieważ uczestniczą w niej również słuchacze. Dzięki nim piosenki nabierają nowych znaczeń, stają się niezależne. Możesz sprawdzić czy rezonują w ludziach. Przejrzeć się w nich zaglądając przez cudzą wrażliwość. Na to czekałem najbardziej.”

           EXPLICAÇÃO DA LETRA DESSA MUSICA,  SEGUE ABAIXO:  
explicação para a garotada que não conheceu os anos 80 e 90, e que estão perdidos na letra
dessa musica, e ficam comentando absurdos e baixarias..., um rápido resumo da musica.
Para entender, o crítico musical e pesquisador André Domingues sugere observar três blocos e referências que se misturam. Um deles menciona amigos como Tim Maia e Washington Olivetto, fundador da agência de publicidade W/Brasil (arrá, sacou?). Outro traz referências ao Rio de Janeiro, como a favela do Jacarezinho e o morro da Mangueira. Também se refere ao tráfico de drogas, gírias para entregadores (""avião""), policiais (""disco voador"") e uma menção ao traficante Escadinha. Já o terceiro bloco trata da situação política em 1990/91. Ele ironiza episódios como o romance dos ministros Bernardo Cabral e Zélia Cardoso e o confisco da poupança no governo Collor. O ex-presidente é comparado ao rei português d. Fernando I, conhecido pela beleza, imoralidade e vaidade.
O trecho: ""alô, alô tia Léia se tiver ventando não venha de helicóptero"" Segundo o próprio Ben Jor refere-se ao desastre de helicóptero do político Ulysses Guimarães que morreu  perto de Angra dos Reis, porém seu corpo nunca foi encontrado. A tia Léia foi empresária do Gil, do Caetano, da Gal e foi também do Jorge Ben Jor, e costumava visitar  Búzios de helicóptero. 
Por isso a ironia se estiver ventando não venha de helicóptero.

dalszöveg:

kint az utcán, át a téren
kerestelek a közértben délben
vagy a télben és a sárban
én mindig mindent megpróbáltam

hóban áztam, mindig fáztam
a lottózónál mindig vártam
kerestelek minden éjben 
hátha eljössz mint a mesében

de nem jöttél, és nem jön el
nem hiszem, hogy érdekel:
hol van már a világvége
az Élet mégis csak megérte

Hol volt, hol nem
én hiszek még a mesében
talán már láttalak olyan
ismerős vagy valahonnan

te lennél mindig nekem az élet
üvölteném jó hangosan
a csel, a gól, a B-közép
abban minden benne van

egy útvonal, egy helyszín kint vagy bent
egy klubban lent vagy a Face-en fent
az Instán, a Twitteren, a Snapchaten
én jobbra húználak a Tinderen

Letra:

Aún tengo en mi mente el momento
Escuché cuando hablaba con el
Decía que extrañaba sus besos
Y que le tocara la piel

Y le decía que estaba sola… Y yo qué
Yo llegando temprano a casa… Y para qué
Que no hay quien le quite la ropa… Y yo qué
Y yo qué

Yo que orgulloso la besaba 
Al mundo se la presumía
Yo que pensaba que me amaba
Yo que decía que era mía

Yo que orgulloso la besaba (Que va)
Al mundo se la presumía (Que va)
Yo que pensaba que me amaba
Yo que decía que era mía

Me imagino cuanta gente se reía de mi
Cuando me veían en la calle
Ella sabiendo que era el tonto
La busco y yo le digo que se calle

Pues sabe mentir
La escucho y dudo si me debo ir
Me asombra su manera de envolver
Sé que si la perdono me la vuelve a hacer

Y le decía que estaba sola… Y yo qué
Yo llegando temprano a casa… Y para qué
Que no hay quien le quite la ropa… Y yo qué
Y yo qué

Yo que orgulloso la besaba 
Al mundo se la presumía 
Yo que pensaba que me amaba
Yo que decía que era mía

Yo que orgulloso la besaba (Que va)
Al mundo se la presumía (Que va)
Yo que pensaba que me amaba
Yo que decía que era mía

Sentí que se me desgarraba el alma
Sentí que poco a poco moriría
Y vi como iba perdiendo la calma
Por alguien que no vale la pena
Y hoy que me busca hace que me ría

Y le decía que estaba sola… Y yo qué
Yo llegando temprano a casa… Y para qué
Que no hay quien le quite la ropa… Y yo qué
Y yo qué

Aquel momento inolvidable cuando hacíamos el amor (RKM y Ken-Y) 
Cuando al oído me decías que todo era perfecto (Natti Nat) 
Ahora solo dices que lo nuestro término (Pina Records) 
Y a lo vivido ahora le encuentras mil defectos 

Yo ya no extraño tus besos (Yo ya no extraño tus besos) 
Yo ya no extraño tu cuerpo (Yo ya no extraño tu cuerpo) 
Y aquellas noches de sexo murieron en el colchón 

Y que no extrañas mis besos (Y que no extrañas mis besos) 
Ahora no extrañas mi cuerpo (Ahora no extrañas mi cuerpo) 
Y aquellas noches de sexo murieron en el colchón (Eliel) 
Que tanto tú que te engañas 
Si yo ya no siento nada 
Todo quedo en el olvido 
Ya nadie de ti me habla 
Y tanto tú que te engañas 
Si a ti nadie te cree nada 
Si tú eres loco conmigo 
Yo sé que aún no ha nacido, otra como yo

Tonto 
No te hagas el tonto 

Que tonto yo 
Que con mentiras quise engañarme 
Aunque descubrí todas tus partes 
Dime por qué tú 
Quieres restregarme 

Que todo este tiempo fuiste mi mejor amante 
Juro que miento 
Cuando digo que no te pienso 
Me disfrutaba la aventura 
Y se ha quedado en la basura 

Pero juro que miento 
Cuando digo que no te pienso 
Me disfrutaba la aventura 
Y se ha quedado en la basura

Si yo ya no siento nada 
Todo quedo en el olvido

Si a ti nadie te cree nada 
Si tú eres loco conmigo Yo sé que aún no ha nacido otra como yo

Yo haré lo mismo así que no regreses 
Cuando veas que otro disfruta conmigo 
De todo lo que por tonto hoy te pierdes (x2) 

Y miento 
Cuando digo que no te pienso 
Me disfrutaba la aventura 
Y lo he quedado en la basura 

Que tonto bebé

Letra:

El cielo se me ha ido la vida 
pues no te quedan más razones para amarme 
el lado izquierdo de mí cama está vacío 
y al otro lado tu foto insiste en hablarme 

Me dices que en las noches sientes frio 
que lo peor de todo es que aún duermes conmigo 
que te da miedo que me siga acostumbrando 
maldita sea si ya estoy acostumbrado 

No te preocupes por mi 
yo voy a estar bien 
te puedes marchar 
agradezco el tiempo que estuviste aquí 
te juro que nunca te voy a olvidar 

Y te regalo mi fe 
si la necesitas para caminar 
y llegar a un mundo donde yo no esté 
o por si algún día quieres regresar 

Mientras te alejas más te siento 
y tu retrato me duele en las manos 
mientras te pierdo más te pienso 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento (bis)
no te preocupes por mi aunque se 
bien que sin ti no soy feliz 
no te preocupes por mi 
aunque se bien que sin ti no soy feliz 
mientras te pierdo más te siento 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento 
mientras te pierdo más te pienso 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento 
en el viento ... 

Te llevas la sonrisa de mi vida 
y hasta la sombra se me va con tu presencia 
es imposible que detenga tu partida 
pues es mejor que te lo diga tu conciencia 

Si alguna vez recuerdas que te amo 
y se te ocurre regresar hasta mi vida 
te bien presente que mi amor 
va a estar sentado 
en el lugar que miraba tu partida 

Nunca te olvides de Dios 
he hablado con él y me dijo que tú 
necesitas tiempo para caminar 
y así comprobar que tu vida soy yo 
y se me aleja el dolor 
si recuerdo que lo que quieres vivir 
tal vez por ahora no sea junto a mí 
pero que algún día me darás el amor 

Mientras te alejas más te siento 
y tu retrato me duele en las manos 
mientras te pierdo más te pienso 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento (bis)
no te preocupes por mi aunque se 
bien que sin ti no soy feliz 
no te preocupes por mi 
aunque se bien que sin ti no soy feliz 
mientras te pierdo más te siento 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento 
mientras te pierdo más te pienso 
y tu silueta se pierde en el viento

Lyric:

Te Voy a Amar
 
Esta mañana dijo mi ventana que te vio pasar 
Siempre supiste que algo te faltaba y hoy vuelvo a soñar
Ya no me importa si una vez peleamos
Si algún día te fuiste, si te vi llorar
Yo te juré que si algún día regresabas no te iba a soltar.
 
Cómo olvidar que contigo aprendí 
Cómo soñar mi vida junto a ti
Te veo llegar para quedarte aquí
Y puedo jurar que yo ya lo entendí 
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
Te voy a amar 
 
Recuerda el día, recuerda tus sueños
Cuando éramos uno, cuando no importabas
Éramos pequeños, tú me dabas besos yo, canciones 
No importa que llores, voy a cantarte toda mi vida 
Hasta que tú me perdones 
Si fue mi culpa no te digo que no, pero se quiere lo que se pierde y
Perderte eso hizo crecer el amor 
Te amo y entre tus ojos puedo ver que tú me amas 
Yo contigo tengo todo y sin tu amor no tengo nada
 
Cómo olvidar que contigo aprendí 
Cómo soñar mi vida junto a ti
Te veo llegar para quedarte aquí
Y puedo jurar que yo ya lo entendí 
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
 
Porque por tonto me quedé esperando una llamada
Y sin tu amor yo no soy nada.
Siempre busqué mil cosas y eras tú la que faltaba
Hoy sobran las razones, vente a vivir a mis canciones
Te voy a amar
 
Coro: 
Te voy a amar, hoy tengo lo que me faltaba
Te voy a dar el tiempo que nunca te daba
Vas a volar porque contigo tengo todo 
Y sin tu amor no tengo nada 
Te voy a amar 
Te voy a amar

Dicen que tu eres una amenaza 
Por la forma que tu eres tan bella 
Los hombres se pelean cuando pasas 
Eres la envidia de todas las nenas 
Dicen de ti 
Hablan de ti, mal te desean 
Pero sabes que eres especial 
Digan lo que digan... 

Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos 
Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos 

Esa nena para el trafico 
Salgo a la calle y causa pánico 
Le queda lindo lo que se pone 
No hay quien la dome 
Muchos la envidian pero la envidia se come 

Ella en la calle es un peligro 
Siempre anda ready por el nipro 
En la pasarela nunca pierde el equilibrio 
La veo y vibro 
Ay si me tumbe le arreglo el motor y la calibro 

Ella es un problema siempre 
Causa envidia en las otras nenas 
Ella es tranquila, serena 
Nadie tiene lo que esa morena 
Tiene en las venas 
Mira como menea 

Chey chey chey 
Enséñale como se hace 
Chey chey chey 
Rompe el piso con clase, dale 
Que se mueran de envidia mi 
Reina porque.. 

Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos 
Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos 

La unica en su clase 

Tu eres la numero uno 
Y yo R1 
La cualidad de ella no tiene ninguno 
Nuevamente te aseguro 
Que te va a sentir como si 
Estuvieras en neptuno 

Esa mami es un princess 
Si la logro a conocer 
La voy a envolverla a otro nivel 
La voy a llenar de placer 
Amanecer en su piel te bese 
Dame un sueño y sin mas yo me 
La voy a romper 

Dicen que tu eres una amenaza 
Por la forma que tu eres tan bella 
Los hombres se pelean cuando pasas 
Eres la envidia de todas las nenas 
Dicen de ti 
Hablan de ti, mal te desean 
Pero sabes que eres especial 
Digan lo que digan 

Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos 
Eres una en un millón 
No hay comparación 
Como tu no existen dos 
Como tu no hay dos

Letra (aproximada)

Una historia 
Una que me cuentan como tantas otras 
Pero que no se me va de la cabeza 
He soñado y todo con los viajes del Moreno 

Y con sus dudas 
Cuando era incapaz de elegir un camino 
Y escribió en tres hojas de laurel tres planes 
Y pidió a un desconocido que eligiese por él 

Y marchó ligero 
Sin el peso de las dudas 
Fue de Finisterre a Salamanca 
Allí conoció a poetas 
Conventículos secretos 
Que le llevaron al pueblo de Catalina 

Y así fue como el moreno 
Llegó a Sobradillo 
Y se instaló en el convento 
De Santa Marina La Seca 
A pocos kilómetros del pueblo 
Saliendo por la fuente del lugar 
Camino de los riscos del Agueda 

El Moreno de La Seca, así empezaron a llamarle 
Porque era el mas moreno de todos los monjes 
Venía de las tierras lejanas del Sur 
De tierra de infieles, aunque él no lo era. 

Algunos monjes del convento, entre ellos El Moreno 
Bajaban a menudo al pueblo 
A echar una mano en el Hospicio de Peregrinos 
Y ahí trabajaba Catalina, una moza del pueblo 
Era la mayor de siete hermanos, huérfana de madre 
Y el padre bastante tarambana, así que tenía tarea en casa 
Pero aún así sacaba tiempo para trabajar en el Hospicio 
Catalina era...un rabo de lagartija, una polvorilla, 
Os hacéis a la idea. 

El caso es que Catalina 
Influenciada por una peregrina de Flandes 
Había organizado un conventículo reformista 
En el Hospicio. Y eso era, a mediados del siglo XVI 
Poco menos que un suicidio. 
Pero eran discretos, se reunían una vez al mes 
Con cada luna nueva: 
Las mujeres del hospicio, un bachiller de Vitigudino, 
un hidalgo de Hinojosa y tres monjes del convento. 
Entre ellos El Moreno, que se enganchó 
Vaya si se enganchó 
Al conventículo y a Catalina. 

Hasta que la cosa se torció, por culpa de un viaje a Llerena 
Que nunca tendría que haber hecho 
La inquisición mandó que le apresasen y se escapó 
Encontró cobijo, en una pequeña cueva 
En las Arribes del Duero 

Catalina, sale del Hospicio con la bolsa llena 
De queso y de dulces para su Moreno 
Que le espera ansioso en su escondite 
Cerca del Duero 

El Moreno, muy discretamente está montando un huerto 
Del que ya no queda nada mas que unas chumberas 
Han pasado casi cinco siglos de aquello. 

Que fácil es todo en mitad de lo difícil 
Que fácil perderse en el amor 
Cuando van a dar el paso 
De marcharse de Castilla 
Antes de que el Santo Oficio los detenga. 

Y aquí se acaba 
Bueno no se acaba pero aquí se pierde 
Se pierde la historia de los dos amantes 
El Moreno y Catalina

Chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico 
Jon Z men 
Chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico 
Full Harmony 

No me habla bonito 
Tampoco me trata bien 
A mí me da lo mismo 
Yo nunca me voy a envolver (Yeh) 

Yo nunca la amé 
Nunca la quise ni la vo’a querer 
Solo se lo meto cuando nos vamos a ver 

(High Quality) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico (x2) 

(Yeah, yeah) 

Yo nunca la amé, y ella tampoco 
Yo me enamoré, de su culo y su toto 
Me quita el estrés, chingamo’ a lo loco 
No hay sentimientos cuando la toco 

Ella no me quiere, ella no me ama 
Ella solo quiere tenerme en su cama 
Me chinga se viene después ni me llama 
No me pelea, no me reclama 

Por el lao’, tengo par de potras 
No me jode, si es que estoy con otra 
Si esta con otro, a mí no me importa 
Pero si el la jode le saco la corta 

Le hablo claro, nunca la engaño 
Chingamo’ en la sala, en el cuarto, en el baño 
Yo no la amo, aveces la extraño 
Es mejor así, no nos hacemos daño 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico (Chingamos bien rico…) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico (Bien rico) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico (Yi) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico (Woop), chingamos bien rico (Woop) 

(Yeah, yeah) (Yi) 

No le digo mi amor, tampoco te amo (Yi) 
Ella no me llama, tampoco la llamo (Yiyiyi) 
Quieres chingar pues te busco y nos vamo’ (Raa) 
No quiere peluches mucho menos ramos 

(Hey hey) 
Y no me enamores (Oh oh) 
Yo no te enamoro 
Pichea las flores, que lo que quiero, es romperte el toto (Yi) 

Le regalo pantis, los chocolates 
Una zeta de flores pa’ que se arrebate (Come on) 
A ella no le gusta que yo la trate bien 
A ella le gusta que yo la maltrate (Rrraa…) 

Ella sabe que yo no estoy pa’ relaciones 
Lo de nosotros es amor de condones 

No me habla bonito 
Tampoco me trata bien (Dile) 
A mí me da lo mismo 
Yo nunca me voy a envolver 

Yo nunca la ame 
Nunca la quise ni la vo’a querer 
Solo se lo meto cuando nos vamos a ver 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico (Chingamos bien rico…) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico (x2) 

Nunca me amo 
Yo nunca la ame 
Pero chingamos bien rico, chingamos bien rico (Bien rico)

Oczywiście cały materiał powstał dla ludzi, którzy mają kije w dupie ale którym te kije można wyciągnąć. Nikogo nim nie chcę obrazić, a na pewno nie Gosię Majdan, czy Kingę Rusin. Materiał powstał, żeby wyśmiać pewne zabiegi, które się obecnie stosuje - pyskowanie i prowadzenie wojny przez social media. Kiedy ktoś sam na własne życzenie wyciąga rzeczy i pierze je publicznie, to nie ma co się dziwić, że powstają tak doskonałe dzieła jak to xD

""Mój dom"" to obrazowa, osadzona w czterech ścianach i 9 aktach historia rozpadu związku. Płytę tworzyli ludzie z najbliższego otoczenia Korteza. Praca nad nią zajęła 18 miesięcy. Producentem, podobnie jak wypadku Bumeranga był Olek Świerkot. Większość partii instrumentalnych Kortez nagrał z kolegami ze swojego zespołu (Krzysztof Domański, Kuba Galiński, Lesław Matecki i Marcin Ułanowski). Za teksty odpowiedzialna była Agata Trafalska, która pracował nad nimi z Kortezem. Pomogli im: Roman Szczepanek (znany z Bumeranga), Mateusz Dopieralski (Bitamina) i Maks Kucharski (były współlokator Korteza z duetu Max Fiszer).

Całości obrazu płyty dopełnia okładka, inspirowana frontem płyty ""Blues"" zespołu Breakout. Zdjęcie okładkowe zrobił Konrad Prajsnar, najbliższy przyjaciel Korteza.

Płytę zapowiadał singiel ""Dobry moment"", który w dzień po premierze trafił do grona najpopularniejszych filmów na polskim YT, a płyta jeszcze w przedsprzedaży zajęła pierwsze miejsce na TOP 100 empiku.

... jsem Čechem, ale vím, že bez Poláků, bez Polska, bez našich blízkých sousedů bych nebyl celý. Polsko, velmi Ti děkuji.""

Jaromír Nohavica (* 7. června 1953 Ostrava) je významný český folkový písničkář, textař, libretista, osobitý zpěvák, skladatel a kytarista. Hraje také na heligonku. Pochází z Ostravy. První píseň napsal již v osmi letech. Na kytaru hraje od svých třinácti let, přičemž původně jeho otec chtěl, aby hrál na housle, k těm ale nepřilnul. Sám se však navíc naučil hrát na několik hudebních nástrojů. V letech 1978–1981 dálkově studoval na SŠ knihovnické v Brně. Začal také studovat na Vysoké škole báňské, ale studia přerušil, vystřídal několik zaměstnání, načež raději zůstal volným textařem. V tomto oboru se proslavil textem Lásko, voníš deštěm pro Marii Rottrovou[1] (She’s Gone od Black Sabbath), ale psal také například pro Věru Špinarovou ad. Později začal samostatně vystupovat, v posledních letech i s kapelou. Spolupracoval s méně významnými regionálními kapelami, ale také například se skupinou Čechomor. Jako herec ztvárnil roku 2002 hlavní roli „Jarka Nohavici“ ve filmu Petra Zelenky Rok ďábla. Za hudbu k tomuto filmu dostal spolu s Čechomorem a Karlem Holasem Českého lva za nejlepší hudbu.

Postupně se stal jedním z nejpopulárnějších zpěváků a v roce 2004 získal i některá ocenění. Časopis Rock & pop vyhodnotil jako nejlepší české hudební album od roku 1989 jeho Divné století. Akademie populární hudby jej zařadila při vyhlašování výsledků ceny Anděl 2003 do Síně slávy a byl nominován ve dvou dalších kategoriích.[2] V cenách Anděl 2009 vyhrál v kategorii nejprodávanější album a v Anděl 2010 se stal zpěvákem dvacetiletí.

Bydlí v Ostravě, předtím žil v Českém Těšíně. Má ženu Martinu a dvě děti – syna Jakuba a dceru Lenku. V roce 1997 získal titul mistra republiky ve stolní hře scrabble.[3] Jeho literárním oblíbencem je Bohumil Hrabal. V únoru 2008 bylo vydáno album Ikarus, které bylo nahráno na osmi koncertech v Ostravě v lednu 2008. zdroj wikipedia",65,2346,0,0,1161,2013-10-28 12:16:30,0,"Jarek Nohavica, živý koncert, Polskie Radio Program III, Jaromír Nohavica (Musical Artist), Koncert, Folk Music (Musical Genre), jaromír nohavica, nohavica jaromír, jaromír nohavica koncerty, jaromír nohavica koncerty 2015, jaromír nohavica mp3, jaromír nohavica diskografie, koncert jaromír nohavica, jaromir nohavica akordy, jaromír nohavica darmoděj, jaromír nohavica milionář, jaromír nohavica texty, youtube jaromir nohavica, jaromír nohavica ostrava, nohavica kometa",Jarek Nohavica - koncert z polského rádia 3  2013 - 1. část,ZYDmhQWGKec,367970,CPoBEAA,z,0,13,10,28,301,0,5.565812412788863,1.9956351945975501,3.064832219738574,1.8129133566428557,5,44,-0.16666666666666666,347,0.0,19,0.0,12,0,4,0,2,1,2,0,0,2,2,0,3,1,0,1,4,1,0,3,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,59,0.5506531647916026,0.3585523633552709,1.6905563680186106,0,0,1.0
