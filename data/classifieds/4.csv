Here's the lyrics -


+The loser club





S s Somebody once told me,
I should give up on Georgie,
Everybody thinks that he's dead,
I k k know it might seem dumb,
But I can't be the only son,
So I'll keep on looking instead,



Well the club starts forming,
And they all start swarming,
Ben mike and Beverly all gotta join in,
It is the summer should be having fun,
But instead we get chased always on the run,
Soo many questions, answer me,
Why do kiddies go missing in Derry,
How are we to survive in this town,
When we're being hunted by a evil clown,





Hey now join the loser club, gotta man up,
Fight it,
Hey now it's the loser club, can't letup,
Fight it,
Remember we're stronger as one,
We're only in danger when we're alone,





This town is weird and it's getting even weirder,
There's soo many kids that just disappear,
But me I won't be one of them, no,
Cus I got the best friends and we all go,

Hunting the shape shifting beast, dumb,
Time spent with bev is at least, fun,
But I can't forget, my mission,
Georgie's not dead, he's just missing,




Hey now join the loser club, gotta man up,
Fight it,
Hey now it's the loser club, can't letup,
Fight it,
Remember we're stronger as one,
We're only in danger when we're alone,


(Break)
(Pennywise)

Hey Billy,
Welcome to my crack house,
You all love running off on your own don't you Billy?
I remember Georgie did the same thing, haha


(Billy)

Hey now join the loser club, gotta man up,
Fight it,
Hey now it's the loser club, can't letup,
Fight it,
Remember we're stronger as one,
We're only in danger when we're alone,



(Pennywise)

Hey Billy it's your buddy, Georgie's here to party,
He'll be waving his little stump, haha,
He's inept, what a concept,
Soon the rest of your group will have to accept,
The same fortunate fate,




They break into my house,
And they all start running,
Screaming making noise of course I'm gonna eat em,
It is the summer should be having fun,
But instead you're food for my tum tum,
Did you really think you could kill me,
I'm pennywise a shape shifting beast,
Haha I'm a dancing clown,
Don't ever forget Derry is my town,






(Billy)


Hey now join the loser club, gotta man up,
Fight it,
Hey now it's the loser club, can't letup,
Fight it,

LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light

CHORUS 1:
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star
A signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I


VERSE 2:
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

CHORUS 2:
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky 
A canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
 
BRIDGE:
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I

If the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

VERSE 3:
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die
 
CHORUS 3:
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I

I can see Your heart
Eight billion different ways
Every precious one
A child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

TAG:
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

可惜不是你

曲：曹軒賓
詞：李焯雄

這一刻 突然覺得好熟悉  
像昨天 今天同時在放映 
我這句語氣 原來好像你  
不就是我們愛過的證據 

差一點 騙了自己騙了你  
愛與被愛不一定成正比 
我知道被疼是一種運氣  
但我無法完全交出自己 

努力為你改變  
卻變不了 
預留的伏線 
以為在你身邊 那也算永遠  
仿佛還是昨天 
可是昨天 已非常遙遠  
但閉上雙眼 
我還看得見 

可惜不是你 
陪我到最後  
曾一起走卻走失那路口 
感謝那是你 
牽過我的手  
還能感受那溫柔 

那一段 我們曾心貼著心  
(我想我更有權力關心你) 
可能你 已走進別人風景  
多希望 也有 星光的投影 

努力為你改變  
卻變不了 
預留的伏線 
以為在你身邊

Urban Electro Band NU'EST
The 5-member boy group NU'EST is making their debut with their album [FACE] in March 2012, having already received astonishing reactions and secured fans from varying age groups through their diverse television appearances and events prior to their debut. 

NU'EST stands for 'NU(New), Establish, Style, Tempo', signifying how they are creating a new style to the music. Composed of members JR, Aron, Baekho, Minhyun, and Ren, NU'EST is at the center of attention for their outstanding musical skills as well as perfect visuals, seeking to take over the K-pop scene with their unique color, style, and music. 

Composed by the Swedish composer Daniel Barkman, the title song ""Face"" applies the currently popular dubstep, differentiating it from other K-pop music with an addictive chorus line that stands out. The song delivers the style and power of NU'EST with powerful rhythms and refined and lively synthesizer and bass sounds.

ニューイースト（NU'EST）_ FACE
Urban Electro Band NU'EST
デビュー前から様々な放送活動やイベントで爆発的な反応と多様なファン層を集めてきた5人組ボーイズ・グループ、ニューイースト（NU'EST）が、2012年3月デビューアルバム[FACE]で電撃デビューする。

'NU（New）、Establish、Style、Tempo'の頭文字を取ったグループ名、ニューイースト（NU'EST）には、'音楽に合わせ新しいスタイルを創り出す'という意味が含まれている。 JR、Aron、ベクホ、ミンヒョン、レンの5人組ボーイズ・グループ、ニューイースト（NU'EST）は優れた音楽的実力と完璧なビジュアルを同時に備え人気を集めている。ニューイースト（NU'EST）ならではの色とスタイルの音楽で歌謡界を占領する予定だ。

タイトル曲「FACE」は、スウェーデンの作曲家ダニエル・バークマンの曲で、最近流行しているタブステップを応用して既存の歌謡と差別化を図っており、中毒性のあるサビのリフレインが引き立つ曲だ。強烈なリズム、洗練されたノリのいいシンセやベースで、ニューイースト（NU'EST）ならではの洗練された強烈さを伝える。


Urban Electro Band NU'EST
2012년 3월 데뷔 전 다양한 방송활동과 이벤트를 통해 폭발적인 반응과 다양한 연령대의 팬층을 모아 온 5인조 보이 그룹 뉴이스트(NU'EST)가 데뷔 앨범 [FACE]로 전격 데뷔한다.

뉴이스트(NU'EST)는 'NU(New), Establish, Style, Tempo'의 약자로 '새로운 스타일을 음악에 맞춰 창조한다'는 의미를 지니고 있다. JR, Aron, 백호, 민현, 렌으로 구성된 5인조 보이 그룹 뉴이스트(NU'EST)는 뛰어난 음악적 실력과 완벽한 비쥬얼을 동시에 갖춰 거센 인기몰이를 하고 있으며, 그룹으로 뉴이스트(NU'EST)만의 색과 스타일로 음악으로 가요계를 점령할 예정이다.

타이틀곡 'FACE'는 스웨덴 작곡가 다니엘 버크만의 곡으로 요즘 유행하는 덥스텝을 응용해 기존 가요들과는 다르게 차별화를 추구하였으며, 중독성있는 후렴구가 돋보이는 곡이다. 리듬은 강렬하게, 신스와 베이스는 세련되고 신나는 느낌으로 뉴이스트(NU'EST)만의 세련되고 강렬함을 생생하게 전해 준다.",17175,224,0,1,839670,2012-03-14 15:00:08,0,"뉴이스트, 로엔, 플레디스, 애프터스쿨보이즈, nu'est, nuest, loen, pledis, afterschoolboys, mv, teaser, kpop, dance, 백호, BAEKHO, REN, 렌, 민현, MINHYUN, JR, 제이알, 아론, ARON",[MV] NU'EST(뉴이스트) _ FACE(페이스),gyXy0m-4bvE,88402283,CDIQAA,a,0,12,3,14,74,2,7.946463480867138,4.936594159937118,5.9241086368499865,4.2348967457315885,7,11,0.2036363636363636,289,0.0,22,0.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0.7455025309200229,0.6212315921193191,1.3988791209185862,0,0,4.0

妖君擎蒼向神族挑起戰爭，神族付出慘痛代價封印了擎蒼，同年天孫夜華出世。七萬年後擎蒼破出封印，青丘狐帝么女白淺再次將擎蒼封印，因此被封法力、記憶和容貌，落入凡塵與夜華相識、相戀，後被帶入天宮。天宮中，愛慕夜華的素錦屢次陷害白淺，並讓白淺誤會夜華冷酷無情，繼而又害白淺被挖雙眼。白淺傷心欲絕，產子後，縱身躍下誅仙台。因誅仙台戾氣破解封印，她恢復記憶，為忘記夜華，飲下忘情藥。百年後二人在東海重逢，夜華認出白淺，相隨相伴，再續前緣，更喚醒白淺記憶。面對往日仇怨，白淺問素錦討回雙眼，怎料又中了素錦的計，再不肯原諒夜華。此時擎蒼再次醒轉，夜華來不及解釋，親自斬殺擎蒼，付出生命封了東皇鐘，面對魂飛魄散的夜華，白淺悔恨自責。幸而三年後，夜華蘇醒，二人再續前緣。

🎤 Lyrics: Selena Gomez - Back To You 

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you 
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

Lyrics:

Stop making the eyes at me, I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go!

I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for

Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me, because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me, and I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go!

Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Are just banging tunes and DJ sets and...

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, considered in his generation as the most successful composer of the Bach family, spent most of his life in Berlin at the court of Frederic the Great. His fame already during his life resided mainly in that he was considered a great teacher, author of the famous book „Versuch über die wahre Art Clavier zu spielen“ („Essay on the True Way to play the Piano“). Beyond that he was famed to be an outstanding improviser, surpassing all rivals. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was especially esteemed by great composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert who all confessed to have learned from him. Yet he never founded any school. His way of composing is singular, intelectual, often somewhat hard edged, always stern, even when he was being witty. It‘s music for intelligent listeners and outstanding musicians because, very much like Beethoven, he never had any regards for the instrument he was writing for.",23,1402,0,1,744,2016-02-09 16:30:00,0,"Bach Collegium München, Bach Kollegium, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Johann Sebastian Bach, Christopher Hogwood, historical instruments, classical music, baroque music, Freiburger Barockorchester, Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, Stefan Schilli","Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach - Oboe Concerto in B flat major, Wq 164",B1wUaqaw1dg,125769,CN4CEAA,b,0,16,2,9,40,1,5.099573607818128,1.9138138523837167,2.8715729355458786,1.3617278360175928,5,6,0.3321874999999999,227,0.0,10,0.01875,12,0,5,1,2,0,3,1,0,2,3,1,0,4,2,3,4,2,1,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,65,0.5631005955367496,0.3752889946425441,2.10877156182976,0,0,4.0

I thought it was time for some more scary horror music, and I then created this piece. It's called ""Ominous Wind"". The idea was to create an atmospheric and eerie background track which could be used in many scary scenes/videos. I tried to make it ambient, ominous, creepy, scary, frightening and dark.

Les paroles de «C’est l’apéro» de David Charles !

Verse 1 Luis Fonsdé & MC Roger : 
si, oh j’avais sou ché cé serait un tel bordel
y aurait pas choisi cé boulot
tou voi....
dis, tu sais moi ça fait des années que c’est pareil
et y a tout qui part dans les impôts
ou jé voi vraiment déjà ché tu as la dalle
jé croi qu’il me reste oun petit bout de pane
et y en a marre avec ça dé boire ché dé l’eau.
Ah ouais
ya franchement quelque chose que je trouve pas normal
et passer à côté d’ça faut être à la masse
tu sais c’qu’on va dire quand on finit le boulot !
Refrain :
c’est l’apéro, c’est le moment de sortir les bières du frigo
chips et le guacamole à la mexicano
c’est l’heure dé té proposer oun bon mojito
c’est l’apéro,  elle oun chardonnay, lui un primitivo
du wiskhi du rhum du gin ya tout c’qui faut
sinon jé pé d’offrir un petit sirop
et on va ballar toute la nuit sur ce petit rythmo
une  saveur dans la boca
c’est mon moment favorito
mais si tu ne fais ché ça, tu vas devenir trop gros
la brioche au lieu des abdo
et ce n’est pas bon pour les gos. 
Verse 2 MC Roger :
Roger toujours présent pour l’apéro
bien plus puissant que Embolo
rafraichi comme une chute d’eau
attention j’suis pas alcoolo
mais tu sais que j’aime bien les bouchons quand ils font poom poom 
comme un tir bouchon qui tourne et tourne et ça fait poom poom
tu sais un verre de rouge on dit qu’c’est très bon pour la santé
de l’eau de l’eau de l’eau bon un p’tit peu juste pour s’hydrater
mais ce qu’il nous faut c’est un bon verre pour décompresser
voilà un memento qu’il faut savourer.
passito passito
suave suavesito

This is a vintage live performance by Jeannie C. Riley of her hit song, ""Harper Valley P.T.A."", written by Tom T. Hall.
Riley was raised in Anson, Texas. This song immediately became a gigantic hit for Riley and went to number one on both the Billboard Pop and Country charts, a feat not repeated until 1981 when Dolly Parton released ""9 to 5"". Riley and the song became an overnight sensation, and the song earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the Country Music Association Single of the Year award. Riley also became one of the very few country artists ever nominated in the major pop Grammy categories of ""Best New Artist"" and ""Record of the Year"".

The song was a phenomenon which led to Riley making country music history in 1969 as the first female vocalist to have her own major network variety special, ""Harper Valley U.S.A."" Then in 1978 there was ""Harper Valley PTA"" the motion picture, and in 1981 ""Harper Valley PTA"" the television show.

Matia Bazar - C'è tutto un mondo intorno (Live@RSI 1981) - Il meglio della musica Italiana
In questo concerto, tratto da una serata registrata nel maggio del 1981 per la RSI - Radio televisione Svizzera italiana, i Matia Bazar regalano alcuni brani in cui il sound progressivo si mescola alla splendida vocalità di Antonella Ruggiero e danno occasione di venire a conoscenza di quel repertorio che fa probabilmente capo ad uno dei periodi migliori della loro carriera.

ABOUT THE VIDEO

This piece is originally written by Paul de Senneville and performed by Richard Clayderman. The piece was rearranged by pianist George Davidson and it is his version I perform here. This version is also incorrectly known as ""Chopin's Spring Waltz"". I believe this is caused by a popular, but wrong titled, video here on youtube.

LYRICS:
ล่องจักรวาลกว้างใหญ่ไพศาลอยู่เพียงลำพัง
จนในวันนึงมีคนๆนึงบังเอิญมาลอยร่วมทาง
คือเธอที่รัก.....
คือเธอคนนี้.....
ท่องจักรวาลขึ้นขี่ดาวหางแค่เธอและฉัน
ไม่ต้องคำนึงไม่มีเหตุผลต้องกลัวอะไร
มั่นใจในฉันโอบกอดเธอไว้ไม่ให้มีภัย
ให้มีแค่เพียงรอยยิ้มอันสุขแสนเพลิดเพลินใจ
แต่ถ้าพรุ่งนี้ความฝันต้องดับสลาย 
มันพังทลายกลายเป็นความจริงแค่เพียงเธอลืมตา
มันคงมลายกลายเป็นความจริงไปอยู่ดี 
ถ้าเกิดว่ารักในครั้งนี้เป็นเพียงแค่รักที่ยืมมา
ฉันคงเศร้าเมื่อฉันไม่มีความหมาย
หากตอนสุดท้ายมันยังไม่สายถ้าได้เธอคืนมา
อย่ามาใจร้ายแล้วทิ้งฉันไว้อยู่ตรงนี้  
เพราะว่าความรักที่ฉันมีจะไม่จบเมื่อตอนเธอลืมตา

(แค่)อยากให้เธอนั้นได้นอนหลับฝัน
จินตนาการว่ามีเธอกับฉัน
อยู่ด้วยกันในราชวังของเรา จะมีเพียงแค่วันของเรา
โอ๋ที่รัก ยามเธอนอนหลับไหล 
ไม่มีฉันแล้วเธอนอนหลับไหม?
นอนด้วยกันมันจะดีกว่าไหม?
Come with me to our galaxy!

ฉันอาจจะเป็นภาพจำลองของคนที่เธอหน่ะหมายตา
หรืออาจจะเป็นภาพลวงที่ไม่ได้ตั้งใจสร้างมา
แต่ฉันเกิดขึ้นแล้วที่รัก
และฉันจะมาทุกครั้งที่เธอหลับตา
เราโอบกอดกันท่ามกลางแสงดอกไม้ไฟ
จูบปากกันบนปากปล่องภูเขาไฟ
นอนลูบไล้ท่ามกลางพายุทะเลทราย
ก็มันเป็นฝันของเธอ จะทำอะไรก็ตามใจ
เธอบอกว่ามีความสุขอย่างที่ไม่เคยได้จากใคร
ถ้าหากเธอตื่นจากฝันอยากเห็นฉันนอนอยู่ถัดไป
ฉันโคตรอยากอยู่ตรงนั้นที่รัก
แต่หน้าฉันเธอยังจำไม่ได้ด้วยซ้ำไป
และเมื่อแดดส่องฟ้า เมื่อเธอตื่นจากหลับไหล
ได้โปรดอย่าพยายามนึกว่าฉันนั้นเป็นใคร
เพื่อเธอจะได้ไม่หาใครเข้ามาทดแทนฉัน
เพื่อเธอจะได้ตั้งตารอจะเจอกับฉันในฝัน

""Piazza San Marco with Jugglers"" by Luca Carlevaris (1663 - 1730)

*Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni was a Venetian Baroque composer. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, some of which is regularly recorded.

Born in Venice, Republic of Venice, to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant in Venice, he studied violin and singing. Relatively little is known about his life, especially considering his contemporary stature as a composer, and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived. In 1694 he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII); Ottoboni was an important patron in Rome of other composers, such as Arcangelo Corelli. Albinoni was possibly employed in 1700 as a violinist to Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, to whom he dedicated his Opus 2 collection of instrumental pieces. In 1701 he wrote his hugely popular suites Opus 3, and dedicated that collection to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

In 1705, he was married; Antonino Biffi, the maestro di cappella of San Marco was a witness, and evidently was a friend of Albinoni's. Albinoni seems to have no other connection with that primary musical establishment in Venice, however, and achieved his early fame as an opera composer at many cities in Italy, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. During this time he was also composing instrumental music in abundance: prior to 1705, he mostly wrote trio sonatas and violin concertos, but between then and 1719 he wrote solo sonatas and concertos for oboe.

Unlike most composers of his time, he appears never to have sought a post at either a church or noble court, but then he was a man of independent means and had the option to compose music independently. In 1722, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, to whom Albinoni had dedicated a set of twelve concertos, invited him to direct two of his operas in Munich.

Around 1740, a collection of Albinoni's violin sonatas was published in France as a posthumous work, and scholars long presumed that meant that Albinoni had died by that time. However it appears he lived on in Venice in obscurity; a record from the parish of San Barnaba indicates Tomaso Albinoni died in Venice in 1751, of diabetes.

He wrote some fifty operas of which twenty-eight were produced in Venice between 1723 and 1740, while there are a few modern sources attributing - probably inaccurately - 81 operas to the composer. Today he is most noted for his instrumental music, especially his oboe concertos. He is thought to have been the first Italian composer to employ the oboe as a solo instrument in concerti (c. 1715, in his masterful 12 concerti a cinque, op. 7) and the first composer globally to publish such works, while it is likely that the first existing concerti featuring a solo oboe came from German composers such as Telemann or Händel, although probably unpublished. In Italy, Alessandro Marcello published his well known oboe concerto in D minor a little later, in 1717. Albinoni has also been fond of the instrument regarding chamber works.

His instrumental music greatly attracted the attention of Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues on Albinoni's themes and constantly used his basses for harmony exercises for his pupils.

Part of Albinoni's work was lost in World War II with the destruction of the Dresden State Library, thus little is known of his life and music after the mid-1720s.

The Albinoni Adagio in G minor is a 1958 composition entirely composed by Remo Giazotto, which Giazotto claimed to have based on fragments from a slow movement of an Albinoni trio sonata he had been sent by the Dresden State Library.",185,632,0,0,8329,2010-06-14 08:01:18,0,"baroque, classical, venetian, venice, vivaldi, marcello",Albinoni - Oboe Concerto #2 in D Minor Op. 9,LjgndGuy77o,1458285,CPoBEAA,d,0,10,6,14,165,0,6.163842408640168,2.6766936096248664,3.920592862084809,2.2671717284030137,6,24,0.14449685534591195,650,0.0,5,-0.05,9,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,5,5,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0.6360631246167352,0.4342573077262343,1.7292879992140946,0,0,4.0

As our esteemed & lovely Annotator & Musicologist, Kathryn Bacasmot puts it: ""In the years surrounding the composition of the ""Serenata Notturna,"" the prolific teenager/20-something Mozart penned a list that reads like the lyrics to the holiday song, ""12 Days of Christmas"":  sixteen minuets for orchestra, eight minuets for piano, six piano sonatas, five violin concertos, four symphonies, two church sonatas, two masses, and an opera. That's not even half of his output during the decade, for included are a smattering of divertimentos and serenades -- nearly one of each per year. The real treat of hearing the Serenade No. 6 in D Major (""Serenata Notturna""), K. 239 is that is it not ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"" (which was written a little over a decade later). With so much Mozart from which to choose, it's rather astonishing that audiences are somehow always tuned into the same top 40 hits. What can sometimes come across as precious in ""Eine Kleine"" is elegantly precocious in ""Serenata Notturna."" In 1776, while the United States was declaring its independence, Mozart wrote this piece for strings divided into two groups and timpani. Serenades have a somewhat vague formal structure, but by the Classical era the genre settled in to a comfortable multi-movement form, often kicking off in sonata form and containing at least one movement that's a minute and trio (in this piece it's the second movement). The addition of timpani in ""Serenata Notturna"" adds a kind of humorous gravity to the mostly light and frothy spirit of the string arrangements: it's the dark to their light, the espresso to the milk foam. The contrast is particularly prevalent in the rondo of the third movement where the timpani has its own variation before the rondo theme glitteringly nudges back in before evaporating serenely into the evening air.""

CHAVE E CADEADO
(Philipe Pancadinha / Vine Show / Vinícios Poeta / Élcio de Carvalho)

Se o tempo fosse remédio
Eu não “tava” ligando outra vez pra você
Eu tentei, fiquei longe e quieto
Assistindo tudo isso acontecer

Vi seu primeiro beijo em um estranho
Fotos de vinho e taças pro jantar
E a cabeça já “tá” desenhando 
Aquela cena que nenhum ex quer imaginar, não dá

Coitado desse cara aí
Não te conhece nem sabe o que você gosta
Não vai fazer metade do que eu fiz
Tem que respeitar porque eu sou foda

Coitado desse cara aí
Tá procurando abrigo em lugar ocupado
Conta pra ele que é louca por mim
Que do seu coração eu tenha a chave e o cadeado
E eu deixei trancado
E eu deixei trancado

Lembro com muita saudade daquele bailinho, quando a gente 
dançava bem agarradinho
Onde a gente ia mesmo é prá se abraçar, você com laquê no
cabelo e um vestido rodado
E aquelas anáguas com tantos babados, e você sentava só prá
me mostrar


E tudo o que a gente transava eram três, quatro cubas
Eu era a raposa e você era as uvas, eu sempre querendo
Teu beijo roubar, e por mais que você se esquivasse
Eu tinha certeza que no fim do baile, na minha lambreta
aquele broto bonito ia me abraçar


Quando a orquestra tocava ""Besame mucho"", eu lhe apertava e 
olhava seu busto
Dentro do corpete querendo pular. Eu todo cheiroso à
""lancaster"" e você à ""chanel""
Eu era menino, mas fazia o papel do homem terrivel só prá lhe
guardar


E tudo o que a gente transava eram três, quatro cubas
Eu era a raposa e você era as uvas, eu sempre querendo
Seu beijo roubar, e por mais que você se esquivasse
Eu tinha certeza que no fim do baile, na minha lambreta, contente pra casa eu ia te levar


E ao chegar em tua casa, em
frente ao portão
um beijo, um abraço, minha mão, tua mão, com medo que o velho
pudesse acordar
A pílula já existia, mas nem se falava, nos muitos conselhos que
tua mãe te dava
Tinha um que dizia : ""só depois de casar""


E tudo o que a gente transava eram três, quatro cubas

Bengala e Crochê - Clipe Oficial [ Letra ]
Composição: André Vox / René Lunna

Se já estamos misturando as meias
E dividindo o mesmo edredom
No meu guarda-roupa tem sua gaveta
No seu banheiro já tem maquiagem e batom

Adoro quando eu corro pra você assustada
Você é meu herói matador de baratas
E depois de tudo a gente dá risada

Se você já me deu a cópia da chave
O que eu tô pensando acho que você sabe

Eu quero acordar do seu lado toda manhã
Ouvir seu ""Bom dia!"" 
Um café, croissant 
Duas cópias da gente correndo no quintal
Os altos e baixos de todo casal

Eu quero nós dois bem juntinhos
Até ficar bem velhinhos ""Bengala e Crochê"" 
Até o final: Eu e Você.

Sou um homem da cidade
Tô chegando de viagem
Vim buscar minha moça, meu amor
A mais linda desse interior

Sei que aqui há um caipira
Que os seus olhos não tira da princesa
Mas eu chego de carrão
Mostro o bolso e ganho o seu coração

Sou o tal caipira que o granfino falou
Não escondo a questão
A moça é dona do meu coração
Ele acha que o dinheiro compra o amor
Mas se fosse fácil assim

Versuri :

Intro:

Viata, intoarce-ma-n trecut
Da-mi inapoi imperiul ce l-am avut si l-am pierdut
Viata, acum caminul e mai rece
Adu-mi familia-napoi ca sa n-o mai las sa plece

Refren:

Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand se pierd in pahare, ca ploile in mare
Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand viata ta frumoasa, azi a plecat d-acasa

Strofa 1:

Ea fata cuminte, el baiat de casa
Dragostea s-a asezat pe nepusa masa
O vedea numai pe ea si ea numai pe el
A muncit din greu cu ziua sa-i cumpere inel
Si s-a pus in genunchi un pic timid din fire
O cere de nevasta si ii jura iubire
Ea raspunde cu un da plangand de fericire
Inima-i sare din piept sublima traire
Dupa 9 luni se naste rodul iubirii lor
Ce familie, ce viata, ce tablou stralucitor 
Altii ar da ani din viata si-un venit stabil
Sa aibe asa camin asa femeie asa copil
Toate bune si frumoase pana in ziua cand
Tatal vine acasa beat rupt si injurand
Femeia ii deschide, el crede c-a gresit etajul
Etajul nu-i gresit, gresit era anturajul

Refren:
Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand se pierd in pahare, ca ploile in mare
Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand viata ta frumoasa, azi a plecat d-acasa

  Strofa 2:

Vine ziua de salariu, merge iar la aparate
Cu gandul ca se face bogat peste noapte
Pierde tot in doua ore si se imprumuta
Pierde iar, pleaca la bar sa mai bea o suta
Dar alcoolul nu-l facea deloc mai fericit
Bag-o doza in siringa sa uite c-a saracit  
Depravat , mers leganat calca pragul casei iar
Femeia lui il priveste, nervos sare la scandal
O ia de par, o loveste o face in ultimul hal
Copilul lui priveste la un tata exemplar
Mama-si ia copilul, se-nchide in dormitor
El bate cu pumnii-n usa “Fa deschide ca te omor”
Femeia plange, ca n-a gresit cu nimic
i-a daruit un copil, e muncitoare, l-a iubit
isi face bagajul in el isi pune viata
cu gandul sa plece-n lume cand vine dimineata

Refren:
Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand se pierd in pahare, ca ploile in mare
Ce drame ascund ochii tai
Cand viata ta frumoasa, azi a plecat d-acasa

Bridge:
Viata, intoarce-ma-n trecut
Da-mi inapoi imperiul ce l-am avut si l-am pierdut
Viata, acum caminul e mai rece
Adu-mi familia-napoi ca sa n-o mai las sa plece

Strofa 3:

Barbatul se trezeste si striga dupa ei
Vede urme de pumni in usa camerei
Vede si jucariile ce plang in liniste
Si-si vede sufletul plin de neliniste
Vede ca anturajul l-a transformat in fiara
Isi vede toata viata cum e pe punct sa piara
Si-ar da orice pe lume sa-i aduca-napoi
Si-ar curata iubirea manjita de noroi
Afara tuna, s-a-nnorat e frig si-a fulgerat*
Mai mult ca niciodata se simte vinovat
E rece casa fara ei pe unde o-r umbla
Pe unde viata lui pierduta, unde-i familia
Nu pune geana peste geana
Curge doar sare peste rana
Inima se rupe cand vede ce-a facut

Miss Mary :

Sarac sau bogat
Putini sunt oameni intre oameni
Bordei sau palat 
Acelasi sange, alte haine 2x

Dar numai tu stii mama
Ce-armura  port eu pe sub piele
Cand drumul e greu mama
Devin o fiara-ntre stele
Dar numai tu stii mama
Ce om ascund hainele mele
Cand drumul e greu mama
Las lumea sa traga de ele

F.Charm :
 
Ca ai Ferrari sau Logan respiri acelasi aer
Ca n-ai un leu in buzunar asta nu te face fraier
Ca porti aceeasi toala cat e ziua de lunga
Ca ai bratari de aur si pantaloni la dunga
Egali din nastere, pleaca-n cunoastere
Unii cu buna crestere –si asuma faptele
La urma urmei e un circ de animale
Unii-s pradatori, altii victime reale
Acelasi sange sub alte haine
Cu alte ganduri parsive-n taine
Si nu te crede niciodata mai mult decat esti
Ca-ai sa te pierzi in ochii lumii in care traiesti
Nu sunt vreo usa de biserica, dar cred in ea
C-am gasit linistea mea cand crucea mi-era mai grea
Imi dau singur haina jos, tu dezbraca-ma de piele
Sa vezi omul rau vorbit de gurile rele

Miss Mary :

F.Charm:

Mi-au crescut ochi la spate traiesc in Romania
Unde omu-i lup cu oamenii sa-si apere felia
Dar nu–s de condamnat ca viata-i face hoti
Ca se condamna singuri in dube pe 4 roti
Mai aud pe cate unu, eu n-am pret, eu nu ma vand
Mai bine taci  toti suntem doar o apa si-un pamant
Se-ascund pe sub pleoape cu ochi ce-ar face rau
C-asa e omu slab de inger , l-ar vinde pe Dumnezeu
Hainele ne schimba fata ne pun eticheta
Tot ele atrag zdrente de lux in spate pe bancheta
E clar ca esti sarac lipit cand mergi pe bicicleta
Si-a devenit o rusine sa  bei apa de la chiuveta
Caracterul omului se vede de la distanta
E mierea lui Dumnezeu cand se simte-n siguranta
Cat despre mine sunt aici oaia neagra din multime
Dezbraca-te de caracter  sa ma cunosti mai bine

Refren :
A fost greu, trist si innorat
Mi-au curs lacrimi, dar s-au uscat
Din greseli singur am invatat
Cand pui suflet esti mai bogat
Esti prieten cu mine, prieten cu mine
Esti prieten cu mine, esti prieten cu mine
Esti prieten cu mine, chiar si-atunci cand taci

Strofa 1:
O vorba veche, merge la sigur:
„Fereste-ma de prieteni Doamne, ca de dusmani o fac singur”
Am trait prietenii vandute cu un zambet
Ca sunt prea multe suflete, dar prea putini cu suflet
Ca toti sunt cu tine prieteni dati dracului
Dar toti fug de tine, cand ajungi la fundul sacului
Si-mi vin in cap cand imparteam si un covrig
Si cand dadeam patura mea ca sa-i apere de frig

2X Bridge:
Cand am intins o mana nu m-au ajutat
Dar tu voiai sa o faci, erai mereu langa mine
Atatea suflete eu nu te-am observat
Prieten neconditionat si la rau si la bine

Strofa 2:

Imparteam in mod frecvent tot ce aveam si ce n-aveam
Prieteni la catarama, ce bine ne-ntelegeam
Pana cand in cap,i s-a aprins o scanteie
C-ar fi bine sa impartim pana s-aceeasi femeie
Asa-s oamenii ciudati 
Nu stii cum sa mai faci ca pe toti sa-i impaci, 
Prieteni multi binevoitori
Cand esti prea sus te-ajuta sa cobori

Die Leiterin des Instituts für gehirn-gerechtes Arbeiten, Vera F. Birkenbihl, war eine der ganz Großen der Seminarszene. Die Querdenkerin gehörte zu den Erfindern von Infotainment, lange bevor es dafür einen Begriff gab. Sie nennt das (seit 1969) brainfriendly und seit (1973) gehirn-gerecht. Ihre Themenbereiche sind u. a. Brain-Management (inklusive Kreativität), Kommunikation, Persönlichkeitsentwicklung, die Psychologie des Erfolgs und des Versagens (inklusive Stressbewältigung) und Zukunftstauglichkeit: Immer wieder wurde sie als „seriöse Trainerpersönlichkeit"" bezeichnet, nicht zuletzt, weil sie ihren Stoff selbst entwickelte, regelmäßig Longseller schrieb, ihre Quellen sauber angibt, „alte"" Themen systematisch updatede und ebenso konsequent völlig neue Themen erschloß: von wichtigen Aspekten der Quantenphysik und der Komplexitäts- Theorie über Memetik und Humor bis hin zur Zukunftstauglichkeit.",66,4922,0,0,1506,2013-02-08 22:10:46,0,"Vera, F, Birkenbihl, Brain, Management, Erfolgstraining, divx",Vera F.

Lyrics:

I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feeling as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
Cause I can't get you out my mind

Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower

La La Di, La La Da, La La Da
Singing in the shower

We started this track in West Africa with a musical group named Tinariwen. We asked them to play a groove in the key of G, then as we traveled the world we added more musicians to the song. Over the course of our travels, it transformed into a global jam with its roots in the blues.

Playing For Change (PFC) is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. The primary focus of PFC is to record and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos called Songs Around The World. Creating these videos motivated PFC to form the Playing For Change Band—a tangible, traveling representation of its mission, featuring musicians met along their journey; and establish the Playing For Change Foundation—a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world. Through these efforts, Playing For Change aims to create hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.

Ah, o-oh, oh, oh
This-this is the remix
Dices que de mí ya te olvidaste
Y de tu mente borraste
Cuando yo te hacía pom pom pom pom
Pom pom pom pom
Piensas que yo me quedé tranquila
Y los tengo haciendo fila
Mientras que tú inventas dar pom pom pom

[Verso 1: Nicky Jam]
Mami, tú dan ganas de comer, eh
Porque tú sí que lo sabes hacer, eh
Moviendo tu cuerpo como es, eh
Dame esa boquita pa' moder
Ya te tengo arrecha, y yo como un flecha
Siempre que te toco, te prendes como una mecha
Yo no sé por qué tu tienes la mejor cosecha
Baby, dime cuándo, solamente pon la fecha

[Refrán: Nicky Jam]
Lo hacemos por aquí, o lo hacemos por allá
No importa donde sea, mami
Tú escoge el lugar
Yo tengo la cuchilla pa' cortar la torta
No es tu cumpleaños pero eso no importa
Lo hacemos por aquí, o lo hacemos por allá

Me dicen la reina del flow por mi actitud de hielo
Algunas quieren ser yo, pero no les dio
Para qué mentir si no, no
Tú te quedaste solo
Y ahora tengo a J Balvin y Nicky detrás
Y yo les digo que no, no

[Verso 3: J Balvin]
Me gusta como tu cama suena
Cuando mis ganas no frenan
Manejando tus curvas pa' ver dónde me llevan
'Tas haciendo mucho ruido
Cuida'o que los vecinos se enteran
[Refrán: J Balvin]
Como la puse (la puse), me seduce (seduce)
No me he olvida'o, aunque eso es lo que escuché
Pa' que pienses en mí, baby, hasta cuando te duches
Suena y suena y la abrí como a un estuche (dice)
Como la puse (puse), me seduce (seduce)
No me he olvidado, aunque eso es lo que escuché
Pa' que pienses en mí, baby, hasta cuando te duches

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,1314,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his Symphony No. 40 in G minor, KV. 550, in 1788. It is sometimes referred to as the ""Great G minor symphony,"" to distinguish it from the ""Little G minor symphony,"" No. 25. The two are the only minor key symphonies Mozart wrote. The 40th Symphony was completed on 25 July 1788. The composition occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks in 1788, during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26 June and 10 August, respectively). The symphony is scored (in its revised version) for flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings. Notably missing are trumpets and timpani.
The work is in four movements, in the usual arrangement (fast movement, slow movement, minuet, fast movement) for a classical-style symphony:
1. Molto allegro, 2/2
2. Andante, 6/8
3. Menuetto. Allegretto -- Trio, 3/4
4. Finale. Allegro assai, 2/2.
Every movement but the third is in sonata form; the minuet and trio are in the usual ternary form. This work has elicited varying interpretations from critics. Robert Schumann regarded it as possessing ""Grecian lightness and grace"". Donald Francis Tovey saw in it the character of opera buffa. Almost certainly, however, the most common perception today is that the symphony is tragic in tone and intensely emotional; for example, Charles Rosen (in The Classical Style) has called the symphony ""a work of passion, violence, and grief.""
Although interpretations differ, the symphony is unquestionably one of Mozart's most greatly admired works, and it is frequently performed and recorded. Ludwig van Beethoven knew the symphony well, copying out 29 measures from the score in one of his sketchbooks. It is thought that the opening theme of the last movement may have inspired Beethoven in composing the third movement of his Fifth Symphony.

Letras:
Ayer entre mis sabanas te hice el amor
Y todavía no toco el suelo
Todavía siento que vuelo
Dejaste tu aroma en mi cama.
Solo me conformo tocar tu piel
Solo me conformo que tu estés bien
Solo me conformo aguantarte de la mano caminar por la playa ver el atardecer

Corox2
Tú te pones caliente
Yo hoy tengo la suerte 
De tener de frente 
una mujer como tu en mi cama

Que tienen tus ojos, que me están diciendo
Esa mirada lentamente me esta consumiendo 
adicto al rojo de tus labios siempre quiero mas
esa manzana prohibida que me hace pecar

Sí, si estar en mi cama es lo que mas te gusta a ti
Devorarte parte por parte házmelo así
A ella le gusta escuchar música de DeLa mientras lo hacemos en la cama es pura candela fuego que quema
Dícelo De La … Yeah

Corox2
Tu te pones caliente
Yo hoy tengo la suerte 
De tener de frente
una mujer como tu en mi cama

Lentamente acariciarte y provocarte 
cumplir con tus deseos
que solo ves en tus sueños
probar de tu veneno que me hace volar hasta el cielo 
como una estrella fugaz perdido en tu universo 
como si fuera la última cena, el pecado del hombre el mismo cuento de Eva
Marilyn Monroe seductora, hechicera
Señor Jesucristo ayúdame con esta nena

Ayer entre mis sabanas te hice el amor
Y todavía no toco el suelo
Todavía siento que vuelo
Dejaste tu aroma en mi cama.
Solo me conformo tocar tu piel
Solo me conformo que tu estés bien
Solo me conformo aguantarte de la mano caminar por la playa ver el atardecer

Sin ti no existe la discoteca (-coteca) 
Ya te he dado mucho y tú poco me das (dame más) 
De la fiesta eres la pieza que falta (sí) 
Si pa' pasarla rico sólo faltas tú 
Déjate llevar 
Estás ansiosa, lo puedo notar (toma) 
Todas tus ganas las puedo calmar 
Si yo soy lo que te hace falta, y aquí sólo faltas tú 
Déjate llevar (si)

Y no sé lo que tú me hiciste 
Me dieron ganas de desvestirte (Zion, baby) 

Un par de miradas y como si nada 
Va pasando el tiempo, se acorta la distancia 
De tener tus besos, que mis labios llaman 
Empezó en deseo, terminó en realidad 
Y ahora vente, y es evidente 
Que yo te gusto, de lejos se siente 
Déjate llevar, que está bueno el ambiente 
Sígueme el plan, que yo lo tengo en mente

Lyrics:
Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all the way up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all the way up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby

In the Morning by J. Cole featuring Drake.  So, I actually learned about this song from FaceBook.  Finally, it has done something besides cause drama!  Anyway, alot of people were putting ""Baby, you're summertime fine,"" as their statuses, and that's the first line of the song.  I looked it up on Google, and found this song.  I love it!

Lyrics:
[J. Cole] 
Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline 
Im trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime 
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell 
But well, Im wondering what type of shit you wantin' 
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman 
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed 
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees 
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you 
Its only fitting cause Im looking super fly with you 
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me 
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me 
So i threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that 
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that 
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron 
Now we zonin', baby you so fine 

[Chorus] 
And can I hit it in the morning 
And can I hit it in the morning 
And can I hit it in the morning 
The sun rising while you moanin' 

And can I hit it in the morning 
And can I hit it in the morning 
And can I hit it in the morning 
The sun rising while you moanin' 

[Drake] 
Uh, baby you winter time cold 
The night is still young, drinking dinner wine slow 
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show 
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go 
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work, I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in 
I love big women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian 
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me 
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me 
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking 
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open 
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking 
I got bath water that you can soak in 
Things I could do with lotion 
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers 
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it 
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning 
I roll over and ask if.. 

[Chorus - Drake] 

[J. Cole] 
Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own 
God Bless the woman that can hold patron 
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home 
No strings attached, like a cordless phone 
You see my intentions with you is clear 
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears 
Therefore, you shouldnt judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear 
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career 
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah 
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here 
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin 
And you know just what Im talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out 
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn' 
Cooking nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward 
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, thats just a warning

LYRICS:

In the trees
Between the leaves
All the growing
That we did

All the loving 
And separating 
All the turning
To face each other 

I divide
In the sky
In the the seams 
Between the beams

All the loving 
And separating
All the turning 
To face each other

Without biodiversity
I'm nothing
It's like I never 
Existed

Without my home
With no reflection 
I cease to exist

And my children 
Are dying now
Inside me 

All I love
All I know
All I've known 

I am dying now
Inside me 
My children

""Voglio Ballare Con Te""
 
Déjame bailar contigo
 
Yo, Baby K!
 
Faccio un tuffo sotto il sole
Fa già un caldo che si muore
Questa estate non si dorme
Me la bevo come un cocktail
Questo ritmo che mi muove
I problemi sono altrove
Le cuffie sulla testa
Viaggio sotto l'ombrellone
Prendiamoci le stelle 
Che il resto non ci serve
Uscire e fare le sette
 
Ho voglia di andare più forte
Non ci basterà questa notte
Voglio vedere le luci dell'alba cambiare colore
Voglio ballare con te, soltanto con te
Non chiedo la luna ma un ballo con te
Lasciamoci tutto alle spalle io e te
Fino a che nasce il sole
 
Spengo tutto per due ore
Che mi scordo anche il mio nome
Bevo birra col limone
Senza ghiaccio per favore
Andiamo non so dove
Diplomiamoci in hangover
Scottiamocii la pelle poi cambiamoci colore
Prendiamoci le stelle che il resto non ci serve
Almeno fino a settembre
 
Ho voglia di andare più forte
Non ci basterà questa notte
Voglio vedere le luci dell'alba cambiare colore
Voglio ballare con te, soltanto con te
Non chiedo la luna ma un ballo con te
Lasciamoci tutto alle spalle io e te
Fino a che nasce il sole
 
Le giornate così lunghe
Notti sempre troppo corte
Che ti svegli sulla spiaggia
Col rumore delle onde
E mentre la notte finisce
Dimmi che male c'è
Se mentre ballo con lui io penso ancora a te
 
Ho voglia di andare più forte
Non ci basterà questa notte
Voglio vedere le luci dell'alba cambiare colore
Voglio ballare con te, soltanto con te
Non chiedo la luna ma un ballo con te
Lasciamoci tutto alle spalle io e te
Fino a che nasce il sole
 
Voglio ballare con te, soltanto con te
Déjame quiero bailar contigo

Vocalist K.will came back with his third regular album Part 2. [LOVE BLOSSOM] this spring. Debuting in 2007 with 'Left Heart', K.will became an iconic ballad singer in the K-POP industry with the following well-made numbers, 'Dropping the tears', 'Miss, Miss and Miss', 'Present', 'Please don't...' and more.

-Kim Do Hoon, Duble Sidekick, Primary and The name! 
Popular underground and over-ground producers have created two-toned emotions -- familiarity and freshness!

The title song, 'Love Blossom', is another collaboration with producer Kim Do Hoon, who helped work on many of K.will's past hit songs like 'Dropping the tears', 'My heart is beating', 'I need you', and 'Please don't...'. The urban soul genre title track features a funky mid-tempo beat around a piano-strings melody and K.will adds a rhythmical and sweet voice to it.

-Infinite's L and SISTAR's Dasom! A sweet love story of the idol couple!
The ambitious work of MV Director Song Won Young, well known for his artistic quality - sensible pictures and twist plots! 

I U of 'My heart is beating', Yeo Jin Gu and Ji Chang Wook of 'I need you' and Seo In Guk and Ahn Jae Hyun of 'Please don't...' last fall!
This time again, K-Pop representative idols -- Infinite and SISTAR had participated in K.will's new music video. Popular Idol group Infinite's member L, and SISTAR's youngest member Dasom acted as a couple falling in love at first sight and draws a heart-fluttering love story in the music video. MV Director Song Won Young who gained his artistic quality through his previous works like NAUL' Memory of the Wind and Ivy's 'Torn Heart', added beautiful colors and a twist plot to it. 

케이윌 정규 3집 앨범 PART 2. LOVE BLOSSOM

'감성보컬' 케이윌이 정규 3집 앨범 PART. 2 [LOVE BLOSSOM]을 들고 올 봄 팬들을 찾아온다. 2007년 '왼쪽 가슴'으로 데뷔해 '눈물이 뚝뚝', '그립고 그립고 그립다', '선물', '이러지마 제발' 등 숱한 웰메이드 넘버들을 선보이며 K POP씬에서 발라드를 다시 뜨거운 아이콘으로 만든 '케이윌' 이기에 이번 컴백에 대한 기대감은 그 어느 때 보다 높다.

-김도훈, 이단옆차기 그리고 프라이머리, 더 네임! 
언더와 오버의 스타 프로듀서들이 선보이는 익숙함과 새로움. 투톤(TWO TONE) 감성! 

'눈물이 뚝뚝' 부터 '가슴이 뛴다', '니가 필요해', '이러지마 제발'까지 환상적인 호흡을 자랑하며 불패의 신화를 기록하고 있는 케이윌과 김도훈은 이번 앨범의 동명 타이틀곡 '러브 블러썸(LOVE BLOSSOM)' 을 통해 한번 더 '황금콤비'의 위력을 과시한다. 펑키한 미디엄 비트에 감미로운 피아노가 인상적인 '러브 블러썸'은 어반 소울(URBAN SOUL) 장르의 곡으로 지금까지 케이윌의 호소력 짙은 보컬 색을 벗어나 한층 리드미컬하고 감미로운 목소리를 들려준다.

-인피니트 '엘', 씨스타 '다솜'! 초특급 아이돌 커플의 달콤한 러브스토리!
감각적인 영상미와 반전 스토리가 담긴 '송원영' 감독의 야심작

'가슴이 뛴다'의 아이유, '니가 필요해'의 여진구, 지창욱 그리고 지난 가을 폭발적인 반응을 불러왔던 '이러지마 제발'의 서인국과 안재현에 이어 이번 케이윌의 뮤직비디오에도 K POP의 대표 아이돌인 인피니트와 씨스타가 참여한다. 아시아를 평정한 '대세돌' 인피니트의 멤버인 엘과 씨스타의 막내 '다솜'은 한눈에 사랑에 빠지는 커플을 연기하며 보는 이들의 심장을 두근거리게 할 예정이다. 여기에 나얼의 '바람 기억', 아이비의 '찢긴 가슴' 등을 작업하며 작품성을 인정받아온 '송원영' 감독은 마치 한편의 수채와 같은 감각적인 영상미에 반전 스토리를 더해 잊지 못할 한 편의 뮤직비디오를 완성했다.

0,NPR Music,190,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Though his appearance at the NPR Music office qualifies as the first-ever hip-hop Tiny Desk Concert, Somali-born rapper K'naan isn't one to adhere to a single genre. Given that he released a song called ""If Rap Gets Jealous"" earlier this year, it's no surprise that this show found him infusing his music with the sounds of soul, pop and reggae. With the help of a crack backing band, his three-song set — all drawing from this spring's marvelous Troubadour, proves what we've been saying for months, K'naan has the makings of a global superstar who's as inspiring as his songs are infectious.

Little translation of Italian Version...
For the freedom, and the success
Wavin' flag, now I sing
How many colours on the stands
And we champions scream ""Go on!""

Adrenaline rises along the spine
while the lateral back rises along the lateral band
from 3/4 he sinks with a central cross
there comes the bomb, goalkeeper can't do nothing EH
For this super event the rest is not important
during these 90 min. other feasts don't exsist
whith the smile on your face, for that Round Golden Globe,
you sweat every second in the World Cup
You wave your flag for your team, your national anthem galvanize yourself
and the colored stadium is your home now
with your friends you think ""this Celebration's for us,
all world wide is around us!""

I feel this passion
Strong in my hearth
I wave under sunshine
the desire for freedom

But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

I see the magazine workin' that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)
She says, Boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll

Lyrics:
You keep dreaming and dark scheming
Yeah, you do
You're a poison and I know that is the truth
All my friends think you're vicious
And they say you're suspicious
You keep dreaming and dark scheming

Yeah, you do
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning

You're so plastic and that's tragic
Just for you
I don't know what the hell you gonna do
When your looks start depleting
And your friends all start leaving
You're so plastic and that's tragic
Just for you

I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning

My life's okay
Yeah, just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me

Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)

Lyrics:

Girl You Know It's True
Girl I'm Gonna Miss You
I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me 'round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on your lovers cross awhile
You put a spell on me
You took my breath away
But there was nothing I could do
To make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change
My point of view
Oh girl, I'm gonna miss ya baby

Given all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leaving
Now I'm sitting here wasting my time
I just don't know what I should do

Hard To Say I'm Sorry (1982)

""Everybody needs a little time away.""
I heard her say,
""From each other.""
""Even lovers need a holiday.
Far away, from each other""

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go (Ooo ooo)

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day
From your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know

Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to

You're gonna be the lucky one

R.I.P John Denver

Lyrics: Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Aint much an old country boy like me cant hack
Its early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God Im a country boy

Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin me a family and workin on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God Im a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the suns comin up I got cakes on the griddle
Life aint nothin but a funy funny riddle
Thank God Im a country boy

When the works all done and the suns settlin low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God Im a country boy

Id play Sally Goodin all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldnt take it very good
So I fiddle when I could, work when I should
Thank God Im a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the suns comin up I got cakes on the griddle
Life aint nothin but a funy funny riddle
Thank God Im a country boy

Well I wouldnt trade my life for diamonds and jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
Iid rather have my fiddle and my farmin tools
Thank God Im a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin thats mighty keen
Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
Thank God Im a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the suns comin up I got cakes on the griddle
Life aint nothin but a funy funny riddle
Thank God Im a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddys till the day he died
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
Said, Live a good life and play my fiddle with prideAnd thank God youre a country boy

My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God Im a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the suns comin up I got cakes on the griddle
Life aint nothin but a funy funny riddle

LYRICS
If we could leave in this moment,
then you will know
that every lie I ever said was meant to go
I cheated all of my chances
and now I see
every pathway that I walked was meant to be

so turn the page let's drift away tonight
let the magic all that ventures be your eyes
maybe we can be happy ever after all these time
after all these time

now that I have finally found me
I'm lifting up higher
I'm sure now the sun is shinning so brightly
It just reminds me
That I'm where I'm supposed to be

Forget the past frustrations
that are buring from inside
and allow your dreams to write the chapters of your life
It's the more to come of laughter
that seeks to find
to solve the ever changing levers in your life

so turn the page let's drift away tonight
let the magic all that ventures be your eyes
I know that we could be happy ever after all these time
after all these time

now that i have finally found me
I'm lifting up higher
I'm sure now the sun is shinning so brightly
It just reminds me
That I'm where I'm supposed to be

I am where I'm supposed to be
I am spoker now and I ever was before
And there is no where else I would rather be
I just hope you know
this means the world to me

now that I have finally found me
I'm lifting up higher
I'm sure now the sun is shinning so brightly

About the album:
Black Ice is the 15th studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC. It was the band's fourteenth internationally-released studio album and the fifteenth in Australia. It marked the band's first original recordings since 2000's Stiff Upper Lip, with the eight-year gap being the longest between AC/DC's successive studio albums. Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio album.

Acalma o Meu Coração
Anderson Freire
CD RARIDADE - Março/2013

Não quero interromper o seu silêncio, oh, pai
Mas é só orando que eu encontro paz
O vento da aflição quer apagar a chama
Da minha adoração o mundo é um oceano
Minha carne é um furacão
Minha vida é um barquinho buscando direção
Descansa em minha alma
E acalma a tempestade que agita o meu coração

Acalma o meu coração
O vento está soprando
Mas é te adorando que venço o mar da aflição
Acalma o meu coração
Só venço esse mundo se for em tua presença
Acalma o meu coração

O barulho do mar vem pra me confundir
Oh, pai não deixe as ondas
Minha fé diminuir
Perdoa se pensei que em meio ao teu silêncio
Não estivesse aqui
Viver na superfície sem poder respirar
O mesmo que morrer por não te adorar
O seu oxigênio
Senhor, sem tua presença
Minha fé vai naufragar

Comemorando 25 anos de carreira, Gabriel o Pensador volta às origens com essa nova música (com beat do Papatinho e letra original do Gabriel) inspirada no seu primeiro rap que tocou no rádio de forma totalmente independente e muito ousada na época. Em setembro de 1992, Tô Feliz (matei o presidente) ocupou o primeiro lugar nos pedidos dos ouvintes até ser censurada pelo governo Collor, mas em maio de 1993, a mesma gravação foi incluída entre as dez faixas do primeiro disco do rapper.
Muitos pediram uma nova versão do tema, faz tempo, mas a ideia surgiu quando o atual governo anunciou o decreto que liberava uma área de Reserva enorme da Amazônia para a mineiração.
O clipe foi dirigido por PH Stelzer da Ganja Filmes e gravado em vários estados do Brasil (ver nos créditos finais). Obrigado a todos que participaram do clipe, e mais ainda a todos que participaram e acompanharam e/ou participam e acompanham a longa carreira do nosso Pensador.

O CÉU EXPLICA TUDO [ Letra ]

Eu amarrotei tantos lençóis
Era só eu nunca era nós
Me dava bem no singular
Aah, aah, aah, aah

Bastou uma noite
Um beijo na boca
Um fica comigo pra vida toda
Nós dois sem roupa olhando pro céu
Imaginando a gente de terno e véu

O céu explica tudo
Pros nossos corações
As estrelas são as várias paixões que eu tive
O céu explica tudo

LETRA - Pesadão (feat Marcelo Falcão)

Vou reerguer o meu castelo
Ferro e martelo, reconquistar o que eu perdi
Eu sei que vão tentar me destruir
Mas vou me reconstruir
Voltar mais forte que antes

Quando a maldade aqui passou
E a tristeza fez abrigo
Luz lá do céu me visitou
E fez morada em mim

Quando o medo se apossou
Trazendo guerras sem sentido
A esperança que ficou
Segue vibrando
E me fez lutar

Para vencer
Me levantar
E assim crescer
Punhos cerrados,
Olhos fechados
Eu levanto a mão pro alto e grito vem comigo quem é do bonde pesadão

Ooo ooo ooo
Só pesadão, pesadão dão

Ainda erguendo os meus castelos
Vozes e ecos
Só assim não me perdi
Sonhos infinitos
Vozes e gritos
Pra chamar quem não consegue ouvir

Do engenho novo pra austrália
Pronto pra batalha
Cabeça erguida sempre pra seguir
Se tentar nos parar
Não é bem assim
Ficaremos mais bem fortes do que antes

Do sul ao norte
Sonoros malotes
Música da alma pra sábios e fortes
Game of thrones com a gente não pode
Minha ostentação é nosso som
Iza e falcão são do bonde pesadão

Ooo ooo ooo
Só pesadão, pesadão dão

Pesadão, pesadão dão

Se o deles é chique
O nosso é pau a pique
O que não mata o pique
Fortalece a equipe
O som do repique
Peço que amplifique
Toca da Rocinha
Chega em Moçambique

Sábias palavras da sua companhia
Muitos passos, passos no seu caminho
Atitude, papo-reto, pesadão, dialeto
Repique como raio-de-giz
Iza como imperatriz
Amizades e elos
Novos castelos

Iza e falcão são do bonde pesadão

LYRICS

I went looking for trouble
And boy
I found her...

She's in love with herself.
She likes the dark
On her milk white neck.
The Devil's mark.

It's all Hallows Eve.
The moon is full.
Will she trick or treat?
I bet she will.

She will.

Happy Halloween.

She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu.
Oh baby, Lilly Munster.
Ain't got nothing on you.

Well when I called her evil
She just laughed.
And cast that spell on me.
Boo Bitch Craft.

Yeah you wanna go out

Black black black black No. 1.

Little wolf skin boots
And clove cigarettes.
An erotic funeral
For which she's dressed.

Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves.
Everyday is Halloween.

Yeah you wanna go out
'cause it's raining and blowing.
You can't go out

LETRA:
Pensa que me engana?
Isso, mente, falando que ama
Perguntava quem era eu e hoje me dá por causa da minha fama
Vai virar o meu brinquedo, mas aquele que eu já enjoei
E o jeito que você me ama, um dia sim eu já também te amei

Me esforcei pra ganhar teu coração
E tu me deu bota, o assunto era só não
Isso quando respondia, eu implorava sua atenção
Hoje em dia me fala: “me beija”; eu falo: “não, não, não”

Vai ficar querendo
O mundão girou e nessa tu saiu perdendo

Siga a seta e vê se não erra
A estrada até meu coração
Vem direto o amor tá com pressa
E quer saber se essa paixão tá fantasiada de algo a mais
Ou é só mais uma história dessas baseadas em beijos reais

Meu destino tava distraído não olhou pra frente olha só no que deu
Bateu de frente com o seu bateu de frente com o seu

She's got a smile it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Zespół P.Unity to unikatowa fuzja funku soulu, jazzu i rapu. Po świetnie przyjętej epce ""Mango"" i wielu niezapomnianych koncertach przyszedł czas na debiutancki album. ""Pulp"" LP ukaże się 05.10.18 sumptem U Know Me Records, a dystrybucję zapewni Asfalt Distro. Materiał został zarejestrowany w Quality Studio. Wsparcie medialne albumu: Aktivist, Going., Jazz Forum, Michał Urbaniak presents, SoulBowl i Radio Kampus.

""FUNKJEST"" is the second single from forthcoming P.Unity's debut LP ""Pulp"" [UKM 069], which will be released on the 5th October 2018.

[PL] P.Unity to dziesięcioosobowy, warszawski projekt osadzony w funkowej stylistyce. Zainspirowani działalnością artystów spod znaku Parliament/Funkadelic, mniej popowymi dokonaniami Prince’a czy koncertowym dorobkiem D’Angelo i Soultronics, muzycy chcą odczarować obraz funku rozumianego dziś często jako easy-listeningowe brzmienie rodem z dyskotek statków wycieczkowych. Funk P.Unity to nie cekiny i brokatowe dzwony - to ukłon w stronę psychodelicznego oblicza George’a Clintona i brudnych brzmień Sly & The Family Stone, to bardziej nieuchwytny nastrój niż czysto techniczne określenie gatunkowe. Zespół buduje swoje brzmienie czerpiąc również z dorobku licznych spadkobierców funkowej stylistyki - od hiphopowych gigantów jak Snoop Dogg czy A Tribe Called Quest, przez neosoulową scenę spod znaku Soulquarians, po beatowych i elektronicznych innowatorów skupionych wokół labelu Brainfeeder. Zespół ma na koncie EPkę „Mango” (2017), która otworzyła grupie drzwi na wiele polskich scen. Materiał dotarł również do legendy polskiego jazzu - Michała Urbaniaka, który zaprosił P.Unity do współpracy przy ostatnim albumie projektu Urbanator Days - „Beats & Pieces”. Na krążek trafiły dwa utwory zaaranżowane i nagrane przez zespół - „P.Lex” i „Wasabi Vibe” i zostały docenione przez polskie media. Ostatnio zespół został świetnie przyjęty na festiwalach Spring Break i GoodVibe  oraz występach klubowych w Krakowie, Lublinie, Łodzi i Warszawie. Kolejna trasa wkrótce.

[ENG] P.Unity is a ten-piece, funk-oriented band based in Warsaw,Poland. Inspired by acts from the Parliament/Funkadelic family, less poppy side of Prince and live work of D’Angelo and Soultronics, the group aims at overturning the understanding of funk as an easy-listening sound of cruise liner’s discos. P.Unity’s funk has nothing to do with spangles and glittery flare-pants- it is a tribute to the psychedelic side of George Clinton and gritty sounds of Sly & The Family Stone. For P.Unity funk is more of an indefinable vibe than straight technical term of genre. The band also draws on the legacy of funk’s successors- from hiphop giants like Snoop Dogg or A Tribe Called Quest, through neosoul artists centered around Soulquarians, to the young electronic beats scene of Brainfeeder. P.Unity works in an almost unchanged lineup since 2014. The group released their debut Mango EP (2017), that made band’s way to many live venues. The record reached a Polish jazz legend Michał Urbaniak, who invited P.Unity to work with him on the last Urbanator Days album „Beats & Pieces”. The LP contained two tracks arranged and recorded by the band- „P.Lex” and „Wasabi Vibe” were appreciated by Polish media.

I borrowed my sister's Yamaha keyboard (see this video), on which I only spent 16 hours and 44 minutes. As a result, I only managed to record ""Introduction and Dance"" and learned ""La Cucaracha"". It took me 11 hours to learn this piece. The first six bars cost me one hour to learn; I invested four hours to study the 9th -- 15th bars. I also spent six hours to practice and memorize this piece.

함께 모여 나누는 기쁨, 'Break Bread'

최근 3년 동안 각자의 행보에 집중해왔던 하이라이트레코즈(Hi-Lite Records) 소속 아티스트들이 오랜만에 다 함께 모여 만든 단체곡을 발표한다.

그동안 하이라이트레코즈는 안팎으로 많은 변화를 겪으며 힙합 팬들의 긍정적, 부정적 반응을 동시에 받아왔다. 그 변화의 과정에서 소속 아티스트들은 꾸준히 자신만의 영역을 구축해 나갔고, 레이블 역시 계속해서 재능있는 아티스트들을 서포트 해왔다. 여러 논란과 우려와는 달리 하이라이트레코즈는 발표하는 작품마다 음악적인 성장을 거듭하며 안정적인 중견 레이블 반열에 올랐다. 올해로 설립 8주년을 맞이하는 하이라이트레코즈는 더욱 활발한 앨범 제작과 창작 활동으로 알차게 2018년을 채울 준비를 하고 있다.

프로듀서 빅바나나(Big Banana)와 유지피(UGP), 그리고 하이라이트레코즈 소속 아티스트들이 스튜디오에 함께 모여 자연스럽게 어울리며 작업하던 중 탄생하게 된 'Break Bread'와 'homecoming'. 다양한 색깔의 아티스트들이 한데 모인 이번 싱글은 팬들의 오랜 기다림에 답하는 작품으로 하이라이트레코즈의 또 다른 시작을 알리는 신호탄이 될 것이다.

The second music video of BTS! ""We Are Bulletproof Pt.2""
It is a song based on TRAP Music getting attention from the American hip-hop scene at the moment. The simple yet powerful drum sound is added on the main riff. It is not a familiar genre in popular music but the addictive melody and rough hook mesmerize the listeners right away. The lyrics talk about the ambition of the rookie group's challenge in K-pop industry. The song can be referred to as 2013 version of 'We Are Bulletproof Pt. 1'. Comparing the two songs, you'll be able to recognize how much BTS has grown up for the past three years.

[MV] BTS（防弾少年団）•We Are Bulletproof Pt2
防弾少年団のミュージックビデオ第2弾！ [We Are Bulletproof Pt2]
現在、米国のヒップホップシーンで注目されているトラップミュージック（TRAP Music）をベースにした曲で、メインのリーフの上にシンプルながらも強烈なドラム•サウンドを加えた。ポピュラー音楽ではなかなか挑戦しなかった慣れないジャンルだが、中毒性のあるメロディーと荒いフックに瞬く間に魅了される。歌謡界に挑戦状を差し出した防弾少年団の力の強い抱負を歌詞で書いた。この曲は2010年にミックステープで公開された「We Are Bulletproof PT.1」の2013年版ともいえる。二曲を比較してみると、3年の間、日進月歩した防弾少年団の実力を鑑賞することができる。

방탄소년단의 두 번째 뮤직비디오! ""We Are Bulletproof Pt2""
현재 미국 힙합씬에서 주목하고 있는 트랩뮤직(TRAP Music)을 기반으로 한 곡으로,메인 리프 위에 심플하면서도 강렬한 드럼 사운드를 더했다. 대중 음악에서 좀처럼 도전하지 않는 낯선 장르이지만 중독성 있는 멜로디와 거친 훅에 순식간에 매료된다. 가요계에 도전장을 내민 방탄소년단의 당찬 포부를 가사로 풀어냈다. 이 곡은 2010년에 믹스테잎으로 공개한 'We Are Bulletproof PT.1'의 2013년 버전이라고도 할 수 있다. 두 곡을 비교해 들어보면, 3년 사이 일취월장한 방탄소년단의 실력을 감상할 수 있다.",16722,233,0,0,1119400,2013-07-16 15:00:33,0,"로엔, 로엔티비, 로엔뮤직, loen, loentv, loenmusic, 韓流, 韓国, kpop, artist, Interview, Scenes, bts, bangtan, sonyeondan, 방시혁, no more dream, 노모어드림, 노 모어 드림, 위 알 불렛푸르프, we are bulletproof, showcase, bang si hyuk, rap monster, 랩몬스터, 지민, jimin, suga, 슈가, 진, 제이홉, 뷔, j-hope, jin, Jin, big hit, 임정희, 투에이엠, 2AM, メロンショーケース, 防弾少年団, デビュー, debut, 데뷔, 데뷰, 데뷔 쇼케이스, ヒップホップアイドル, アイドル",[MV] BTS(방탄소년단)_ We Are Bulletproof Pt2(위 아 불렛프루프 Pt.2),gqhWHy0rrtM,92230304,CPoBEAA,p,0,13,7,16,197,1,7.964873640116741,4.741017585324274,6.048985302570712,4.223288219096949,7,29,0.18068783068783068,248,-0.125,47,0.0,8,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,55,0.7594577862608818,0.5952407783904008,1.4322927985871983,0,0,4.0

We got the game in headlocks; I'm talking DDT
She on my TV screen; I'm talking DVD
Prettiest bitches love my cock; I'm talking BBC
I'm in that BBC, niggas know I bathing ape
I'm sleeping with that Nina and I never put my blade away
Silly nigga fix your face, you drinking all that haterade
My candy paint your favorite shake
My baddest bitch your favorite shape
This day and age, they raise the bar now raise the stakes
I'm eating off that paper chase, bread and butter, bacon eggs

You bitch staring, I was on stage blowing indo
Trust me bro your bitch is weak but her booty got potential
Every state I go now rack it up, everything I wear now stacking up
These new niggas can't fuck with us
Yo flacko why they wanna dress like you? Rap like Q? Wear bucket hats like Q?
Probably be the reason why I fucked yo
Only had 1 ? and I fucked them too

Do it the player way. ASAP, TDE we here to stay
You fade away like Jordan J
Still gangster of the year, I'm in your favorite gear
Whispered in her ear, then drove it in hear rear
Wipe my dick off threw my hoody then I disappear

[Verse 3:]
For sho I bring the baddest through

The black girls say I'm mad at you
The illest gangster, no debate

But now my Glock will never stop, and now my stomach always show

Uhh, I'm yo special girl, yo real good girl
Biggest bitch in yo itty bitty world
Comin' up in the ninety nine, every other word I say
Be part of my rhyme
Catch me outside of the club, smokin' seltzer wit Jason
Get my mind fucked up and my heartbeat racin'
You can call me your crafty honey
I don't give a fuck as long as you give me the money
And if you ever violate this, call me a bitch
Or forget to run the [unverified], you better do your little thang
Mack it around and do your little thing
Uh, huh, uh, huh
It's such a vivrant thang nigga, vivrant thang, a vivrant thang

Collagically Speaking is a raw document that seamlessly adheres neo-soul to future-funk, West Coast jazz of the moment to astral electronica, instrumental hip-hop to musique concrète, avant-garde to classical—these are single-take songs, written live in the room, that go wherever this formidable crew's mood goes. The themes that bind it all together are both spoken and inferred: romantic love, universal love, systemic bigotry, the women's movement, quiet power, wild creativity, personal loss and growth.

Lyrics:
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?

[R. City]
Right about now
If I judge for life, man, would you stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright
Come on show me that you know
Now tell me would you really ride for me
Baby tell me would you die for me
Would you spend your whole life with me
Would you be there to always hold me down
Tell me would you really cry form
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around

[Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?

[R. City]
Let's get it down
All I wanna is somebody who really love me much
A girl that I know I can trust
To be there when money lost
If I did not talk nothing else to give but love
Would that really be enough
Gotta need to know
Now tell me would you really ride for me
Baby tell me would you die for me
Would you spend your whole life with me
Would you be there to always hold me down
Tell me would you really cry form
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around

[Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?

[R. City]
Tell me tell me would you want me
Tell me tell me would you call me
If you knew I wasn't balling
Cause I need girl who's always by my side
Tell me tell me do you need me
Tell me tell me do you love me
Or is it just tryna play me
Cause I need a girl to hold me down for life

[Adam Levine]
If I got locked away

Connect-R - Rece Ca Decembrie | Versuri

Tu de vita nobila
Eu, un vagabond
Destul de capabila
Sa te descurci cu un domn

Spuneai ca-ti place cum sunt eu
Da' ma vrei mai periculos
Eu ma schimbam pentru tine
Pana mi-ai spus ""Nu te mai recunosc""

Si stiu, tu nu stii sa iubesti
Te-as mai citi, da' n-am timp de povesti
Astept sa vina mai, dar mai e, asa ca plec
Rece ca decembrie, tu ma faci sa cred ca

Degeaba-ti dau eu dragostea
Esti rece ca decembrie
Ca o consumi prea repede
Esti rece ca decembrie

Soare sa fiu, sa te iubesc
Stiu ca tot nu te topesc
Degeaba iti dau eu dragoste
Esti rece ca decembrie

Eram pe la liceu
Ai aparut in drumul meu
Te conduceam la troleu
Pana cand ti-ai luat coupe-u

Da' poate c-am gresit
Dar de ce ma vad silit s-o recunosc la infinit
Da' poate n-am gresit
Si, cumva, ce s-a intamplat, a fost menit

Stiu, tu nu stii sa iubesti
Te-as mai citi, da' n-am timp de povesti
Astept sa vina mai, dar mai e, asa ca plec
Rece ca decembrie, tu ma faci sa cred ca

Degeaba-ti dau eu dragostea
Esti rece ca decembrie
Ca o consumi prea repede
Esti rece ca decembrie

Soare sa fiu, sa te iubesc
Stiu ca tot nu te topesc
Degeaba iti dau eu dragoste
Esti rece ca decembrie

Fulgi de zapada
Acopera sufletul tau
Si lasa-i sa cada
Eu am drumul meu

Degeaba-ti dau eu dragostea
Esti rece ca decembrie
Ca o consumi prea repede
Esti rece ca decembrie

Soare sa fiu sa te iubesc
Stiu ca tot nu te topesc
Degeaba iti dau eu dragoste

Lyrics:
Am patru camere si daca vrei
Aici chiria mea nu se plateste-n lei
Si nici in euro ca nu prea ma descurc cu ei
Putina dragoste si e ok
Si printre inimi ma plimb
Si caut una pentru mine
Ca s-o dau p-a mea la schimb
Oh
Da' parca nu mai mai am timp
Si nici cuvinte sa spun ceea ce simt

Tu uraste-ma cat poti de tare
Eu te voi iubi
Fiindca tot ce aud in timpane
E vocea inimii

Daca ma vei supara
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Sti ca te voi injura
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Eu nu ma pot enerva
Ca stiu cum e inima
Asa ca-ti mai zic ceva
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea

Imi spunea cineva
Ca inima e prea complicata
Sa nu-mi bat capul cu ea
Ca n-o s-o-nteleg niciodata
Fiindca asa-i dragostea
Noptile-s furtunoase, 
Prea furtunoase, 
Da
Desi te doare doar ea, 
Iti face zile frumoase, zile frumoase
Da

Da-r-ar dragostea-n voi
Daca da pe la voi, dati si pe la noi
C-o punem in foi, 
O-mpartim la doi
Mai ramane un pic sa dam si-napoi
Cantam Corinteni
Ca fara dragoste am fi nimeni
Amfibieni si ambi avem
Inimi care bat in acelasi BPM

Tu uraste-ma cat poti de tare
Eu te voi iubi
Fiindca tot ce aud in timpane
E vocea inimii

Daca ma vei supara
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Sti ca te voi injura
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Eu nu ma pot enerva
Ca stiu cum e inima
Asa ca-ti mai zic ceva
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
Mai da-te-n dragostea mea
C-asa e inima mea
Vrea inima ta inima mea
Asa e inima
C-asa e inima mea
Vrea inima ta inima mea
Asa e inima
C-asa e inima mea
Vrea inima ta inima mea
Asa e inima

After successfully rolling out his debut album ""Sugar,""  and premiering new music, the multi-talented musician, songwriter and producer comes back on a another level, with the video of ‘Immediately’, the powerful collaboration featuring one of Africa's greatest pop stars, Wizkid.
Shot by Sesan Ogunro and styled by Jennifer Eleto, the visuals of the fusion dance tune, catches the vibe of the song, with flashing lights, street fashion, pretty women, and heavy cameos from Maleek Berry and Kelechi Anyikude. The record was one of Nigeria’s leading summer anthems, and the video is in to give fans more bang for their support.

Wizkid, the Nigerian superstar who has worked with an extensive list of global voices, including Drake, combines perfectly with Mystro, lacing a superb hook which captures the party mood of the track. Mystro's verses compliment that, as they both shine on the record. This is why 'Immediately' is one of Africa’s leading tunes of the dancefloor.

Wikipediaより解説：1990年にリリースされた「WEEK END」の第2章として作られた。Bメロの途中に「WEEK END」のイントロ部分でPATAが弾くアルペジオがそのまま入っているほか、詞の内容も「WEEK END」から発想したものになっている。イントロから全編に渡りシンセサイザーのシーケンス・フレーズが展開されるなど、これまでの作風とは若干違った印象を受ける楽曲。シングル曲ではロックやメタルに当てはまらない系統の楽曲も発表されていたが、何れもバラード曲に限られていた。本作ではロック色を残しながらもYOSHIKIなりのJ-POP色を加えて構成されている。YOSHIKIは当初、「POP過ぎかもしれない」と心配していた。また、本曲の演奏時間5分28秒は長編曲を特徴とするXのシングルA面曲としては比較的短いものであった（これまでは「WEEK END」の5分45秒が最短）。後1996年に発売された「CRUCIFY MY LOVE」は4分32秒と更に短いが、本作以降に発表されたシングルA面曲と比較しても短い楽曲である。

Xの音源は基本的に右チャンネルがリードギター担当のHIDEで、左チャンネルがリズムギター担当のPATAだが、なぜかこの曲のギターソロはHIDEが弾いているにも関わらず左チャンネルから流れている。

1994年以降ほぼ全てのライブで演奏されており、WORLD TOUR Live in TAIPEIまでは主にオープニング曲として演奏されていた。",12,326,0,0,1243,2018-09-28 04:20:54,0,"X JAPAN, rusty nail, DAHLIA TOUR",X JAPAN - RUSTY NAIL Live 1995 Tokyo Dome [Dahlia tour Final 1996 Ver.],nVPFiMb3ric,59210,CDIQAA,x,0,18,9,28,271,4,4.772395061082,2.0863598306747484,3.0944711286416453,1.0791812460476249,4,39,0.10909090909090907,31,0.0,2,0.06818181818181818,13,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,0,1,2,1,1,4,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,71,0.64841051275836,0.4371724896978096,2.8674248556253024,0,1,4.0

★ Szöveg:
Egy hete már, hogy nem láttam a napot,
üres a ház és félelem ül a falakon.
A szemem is ég és lefelé húz a sötétség,
nem látom a célt, minden ingerszegény.

Egy hete már, hogy követ az árnyékom,
egy hete napról napra rosszabb az állapotom.
Monoton a csönd, monoton lett bennem a szó
és nullával osztható. 

Lélekvesztő,
ez egy érzés, amitől már sosem szabadulsz.
Lélekvesztő,
ez egy hely a testben, ahol minden elpusztul.

160 óra, 43 perc,
valljuk be őszintén, hogy ma már meg sem ismersz,
nemigen látok, mert ködös minden képlet,
de magamból ki kell irtanom minden rémképet.

Egy hete már, hogy nincs más szándékom,
csak hogy megtaláljam, mi elől kell futnom.
Monoton a csönd, monoton lett bennem a szó
és nullával osztható.

★ Lyrics:
(Köszi Sonyának és Dzsínek a fordításért!)

It's been a week that I have not seen the Sun
The house is empty and the fear is screaming from the walls
My eyes are burning, the darkness' crawling up my veins
I've lost intention, I care less everyday.

It's been a week my shadow climbs every street 
Day by day I drown myself in my hopeless ruins
Silence is empty, there's nothing left to say
There's nothing left for me

SHIPWRECKED SOULS
there is no way back to the old version of you
Shipwrecked souls
you've arrived where all things die inside you

One-sixty hours, 43 minutes
let's be honest, from you I don't get any visits
Hard to define I failed to see it clearly
but tomorrow I have to get rid of those dark images

It's been a week I can't see the other side
If only I could name that dark beast so I can hide 
Silence is empty, there's nothing left to say
there's nothing left for me

What Washington doesn't understand is that the Tea Party movement isn't a left or right thing, it's an American thing! The silent majority is speaking and you'd better listen. Since the demographics include not only Republicans but Democrats and Independents as well, real change is coming and incumbents are an endangered species!

https://chaotick9.com/music-usage-terms/

--------------------------------------------

""You Can't Hide"" is the latest single off of the FINAL ACT album; a full album dedicated to the Five Nights at Freddy's video game - Sister Location. Stay tuned for the next FNAF song, ""They'll Keep You Running"" - coming soon! 

LYRICS:
Bring you down here in the dead of night
Keep you working
Try to survive
We are secretly watching you too
Trying our best to get at you

RUN

You can Run
But You can’t hide
We’ll always seek
We’ll always find
You can Run
But You can’t hide
We’ll always seek
We’ll always find
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can’t hide
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can’t hide

They’re laughing while finding
I’m hiding, I’m trying
I feel like she’s lying
I feel like I’m dying 
She’s guiding me quietly
Instructing me blindly
Afraid of what might be
I feel like I’m dying

I hear a sound
(it's prolly just a mouse)
I see them in the dark
(I only saw a  spark)
I know there’s someone there
(Not as far as I’m aware)
Why don’t you believe me?
Maybe you’re right
(It’s just another night)
But I heard a creak
(Just go back to sleep)
I’m always quick to rage
(so go back to your stage)
(wait… Now I hear it…)

RUN

What’s that sound 
I know someone’s there
Hiding in the shadows
Thinking I was unaware
Who’s that I see
The birthday boy to be
Let’s invite him over
Hurry up before he’s bolder
Oh Bon-Bon
Let’s make this fun
You can’t deter me this time
No I’m done
I won’t go back to my stage
it’s my new trend
Well let’s say hi to the new friend 

I knew I was right to think I would find you over here
Well isn’t it intriguing that
You seem to be just a little bit weary
Of Bon-Bon and me
Well there’s no need
We know you want to deactivate us
But we just can’t let that happen 
Every night always it never changes
But we can make accidents happen

We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen

Lyrics:

I’m lingering on when they kiss 
Leaning towards this abyss
And of lately the only people I can stare
Are the unraveled ones with their hands laying bare
But their hands are numb and empty
Their dull silence soothes me 
Loud whispers in my back as if I couldn’t hear
Thought I left ghosts behind but they’re just coming near
It doesn’t matter, does it 
If I know any exit 
If I believe in god and if god does exist
 
Rage as a fabric, through and through 
Like that gaze they used to do 
Cause those suicidal thoughts that are still in my head
Give her that awful side-smile when I lay in bed
 It doesn’t matter, does it 
If I know any exit 
If I believe in god and if god does exist
 She’s barely feeding, but she’ll deny
Ribbon-legged, she passes by
Until she surrenders in the midst of the street
And the guys simply stare but continue to eat
It doesn’t matter, does it 
If I know any exit 
If I believe in god and if god does exist
 
And if I am cast out cause I wanted some more 
And if this guy dances way too close to the shore
And if I could just push this door chalked on the wall
And if after the void there’s somewhere else to fall
 Forget I said it
I soliloquize
It’s stinging nettle
Their hands on their thighs
Run if you stole a shard of sunlight
Don’t ever tell them, I’ve got your back
Choking to tears with shards of sunlight
Run if you stole a shard of sunlight 
Save all you can 
You won't be found
And never come back",482,260,0,1,7485,2018-07-05 16:11:19,0,"christine, and, the, queens, doesnt, matter, doesn't matter, chris, official, music, video",Christine and the Queens - Doesn't matter (Official Music Video),UCwD5f1APTY,680339,CPoBEAA,t,0,18,7,5,186,3,5.832725367328817,2.6180480967120925,3.874191804679071,2.6830470382388496,5,27,-0.032877886002886,385,0.0,10,0.0,9,0,3,0,2,2,7,2,0,2,6,0,0,1,1,4,2,0,0,2,4,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,64,0.6642163929712527,0.4488550260529525,1.4439522488663068,0,0,4.0

The album has been further perfected with the participation of Yoon Sang, one of the most highly praised currently active K-pop musician by the public and critics; Saint Binary, famous for his musical activities encompassing electronic music, commercial music, and popular music; and lyricist Kim Ee-na, known for her detailed and sensational lyrics. 
The title song of the most distinctive album [REAL+] is ""Only I didn't know"" by Yoon Sang. Containing his unique nostalgic chord work and melody, the minor ballad differs from traditional ones in its structure and musical arrangements. It gives off a refined feeling as the simplicity and beauty of the scale of actual instruments combine perfectly with IU's self-controlled voice.

今回のニューアルバムは、現在活動中の韓国大衆音楽家のうち大衆と評壇から最も高く評価されているユン・サンと、エレクトロニック系、広告音楽、大衆音楽を行き来する音楽活動で名声の高いsaintbinaryが参加し、繊細かつ感覚的な歌詞を披露する作詞家キム・イナが加わってアルバムの完成度を高めた。
特別さがより増した[REAL+]のタイトル曲は、ユン・サン作品の「私だけ知らなかった話」だ。ユン・サン特有のノスタルジア・コードワークとメロディーが結合されたマイナーバラード曲「私だけ知らなかった話」は、既存のマイナーバラード曲とは違う構造と楽器の配列が引き立つ。簡潔で美しいリアル楽器のスケールがアイユの節制されたボイスと完全な調和を織り成して曲の洗練された感性を感じることができる。

whatever song it seems
i’m still whistling the same old tune

whatever i give 
i’m still running in the same old race

whatever choice i make
whatever road i take
i still wind up in the same old place

so why 
why can’t i change
after all these years
why can’t i change
my ways

Lyrics:

I put your picture on my mirror,
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What happening to me in the dark can you tell me what it means
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
It's the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you when I see you

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Don’t want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you’re down and then between

Ohh I really want to know…

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won’t let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you’re down and then between
Ohh I really want to know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go

Innocent boys who reiterated 'Adore U' to themselves came back earnestly with the first album 'LOVE & LETTER'.  SEVENTEEN, who showed the development as a super rookie with the title song 'Adore U' of the 1st mini album ‘17CARAT’ and 'Mansae' of the 2nd mini album ‘BOYS BE’, has grown more and came back with the regular album that fully includes charms of SEVENTEEN, the 'self-producing' idol group. The title song 'Pretty U', the highlight of SEVENTEEN's love story following 'Adore U' and 'Mansae', is singing the oveflowing heart of a boy for a girl, who knew the girl by 'Adore U' and became closer to her by 'Mansae', through witty lyrics like 'I promise to myself while drinking a glass of water in the morning' and 'You are pretty.'

'大切にする’という言葉を心の中で繰り返していた爽やかな少年たちが、
真剣さをいっぱい抱えて1stフルアルバム『LOVE＆LETTER』で帰ってくる。
1stミニアルバム『17CARAT』のタイトル曲「大切にする」と2ndミニアルバム『BOYS BE』のタイトル曲「万歳」で、
スーパールーキーとして認められ成長する姿を見せてくれたSEVENTEENは、‘自主製作アイドル’という名声にふさわしく
SEVENTEENの魅力をたっぷりと詰め込んだアルバムでさらに成長して帰ってきた。

「大切にする」、「万歳」に続くSEVENTEENの愛の物語のハイライトであるタイトル曲「きれい」は、
「大切にする」で少女と知り合って、「万歳」で少女に近づいた少年が、その少女に胸いっぱいの感情を込めて表現した曲で、
‘夜明けに水を飲みながら誓う’、‘君はきれい’など、SEVENTEENならではのユニークな歌詞が印象的な曲である。

아낀다는 말을 마음 속으로 되뇌던 청량한 소년들이 진지함을 가득 안고 첫 정규앨범 ‘LOVE & LETTER’를 들고 돌아온다. 첫 번째 미니앨범 ‘17CARAT’의 타이틀곡 ‘아낀다’와 두 번째 미니앨범 ‘BOYS BE’ 타이틀곡 ‘만세’로 슈퍼 루키로 인정을 받으며 성장하는 모습을 보여준 세븐틴은  ‘자체제작 아이돌’이라는 명성에 걸 맞게 세븐틴의 매력을 듬뿍 담은 정규앨범으로 한층 더 성장 해 돌아왔다.

아낀다. 만세로 이어지는 세븐틴의 사랑이야기의 하이라이트인 타이틀곡인 ‘예쁘다’는 ‘아낀다’로 소녀를 알게 되고 ‘만세’로 가까워진 소년이 그 소녀에 대해 가슴이 벅차 오르는 감정을 담아 표현한 곡으로 ‘새벽에 물을 마시며 혼자 다짐해’, ‘너 예쁘다’ 등 세븐틴만의 재치있는 가사가 인상적인 곡이다.",3394,233,0,1,192806,2016-04-24 11:00:02,0,"Kpop, 1theK, 원더케이, loen, 로엔, 뮤비, 티져, MV, Teaser, 신곡, new, song, 한류, hallyu, ロエン, ミュージック, ミュージックビデオ, ケーポップ, 韓国の歌, アイドル, 韓流, 韓国, 아이돌, idol, 디노, 우지, 세븐틴, 에스쿱스, 정한, 조슈아, 준, 호시, SEVENTEEN, JUN, WONWOO, WOOZI, SEUNGKWAN, THE8, VERNON, MINGYU, S.COUPS, HOSHI, DK, JEONGHAN, DINO, adore u, 아낀다, 세븐틴 아낀다, seventeen adore u, mansae, 만세, 세븐틴 만세, seventeen mansae, 어른이 되면, Say yes, 세븐틴 엄지척, Pretty U, Seventeen Pretty U, 이놈의 인기, Shining diamond, 사랑쪽지, LOVE&LETTER, 떠내려가",[MV] SEVENTEEN(세븐틴) _ Pretty U(예쁘다),j59LLNMEOZk,10628973,CJYBEAA,u,0,16,4,24,115,6,7.026491303847844,4.073278335635835,5.285120544744956,3.5307118379816567,7,16,0.3017543859649123,289,0.21212121212121213,62,0.25,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,35,0.752170651922777,0.5797030351984109,1.4968994319757944,1,0,4.0

Tragédie u nás na vsi - lyrics

Najdou ji pod lesem
najdou ji pod květem
pod bílým květem divizen
tvář má krásnou

Co stíny kmenů ví
teď z listí stromů zní 
tajemství, co v kapkách rosy spí
a nebe letí v jejích očích

To v dálce zvonil zvon
o půlnoci přišel on
zabil svou milou
a ani nechtěl

Když láska ubejvá
osudem zahejbá
a nic už není
jak bylo dřív

Teď běží udýchán
studeným potem hnán
studeným polem sám
a spát mu nedá
dusot nohou, co prach v dálce zvedá

Už ví, že ho dostihnou
vzpomíná na svou milou
svou vinu vláčí za sebou
a nebe letí v jeho očích",28,246,0,1,1103,2015-10-30 11:08:22,0,"aneta, langerová, Aneta Langerová (Musical Artist), Pop Music (Musical Genre)",Aneta Langerová – Tragédie u nás na vsi (oficiální video),e2YmLwTuSHM,242624,CJADEAA,u,0,15,10,30,303,4,5.384933758410321,1.8129133566428557,3.0425755124401905,1.4471580313422192,5,44,0.0,240,0.0,3,0.0,9,0,4,0,1,2,4,1,2,0,5,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,0,2,2,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,57,0.5650163305515544,0.3366640033057794,2.102448693608288,0,1,4.0

We are The World

Sobre a música:

We Are the World é um LP gravado em Janeiro de 1985 por 45 dos maiores nomes da música norte-americana, com o objetivo de arrecadação de fundos para o combate da fome na África. Os 45 astros formaram o grupo USA for Africa. O single, o LP e o clipe renderam cerca de 55 milhões de dólares.

Inspirado pela reunião que ficou conhecida como Band Aid, organizou a gravação do single We Are the World, escrito por Michael Jackson. O single foi lançado em 1985 para arrecadar fundos para a campanha USA for Africa, em benefício de famílias da África. We Are the World apresentava 44 vocalistas diferentes, incluindo Michael e Lionel, Harry Belafonte, Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper, Diana Ross, Ray Charles e Stevie Wonder e foi produzido por Quincy Jones, que também fez a regência do grupo. A vendagem atingiu 7 milhões de cópias só nos Estados Unidos, tornando-se um dos singles mais vendidos de todos os tempos.

Lyrics:
Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya

Dura Lyrics:

Cuando yo la vi, dije si esa mujer fuera para mí

Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura

 

Que estás dura,

Mano arriba porque tú te ves bien

Estás dura mamacita te fuiste de nivel

Dura, mira como brilla tu piel

Estás dura

Dímelo, dímelo cómo es que es

Estás dura

Yo te doy un 20 de 10

Estás dura, dura, dura

 

Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile

Si no tienes a nadie vente pa mi brazos, caíle.

Ese perfume se siente en el aire

Algo como Argentina tú me traes los Buenos Aires

 

Estás poderosa

Media escandalosa

Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa

 

Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa

Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas

 

Tienes el toque, toque, toque

Miren el material, edición especial

Tienes el toque, toque, toque

Perdóname te lo tenía que decir

Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura

 

Que estás dura,

Mano arriba porque tú te ves bien

Estás dura mamacita te fuiste de nivel

Dura, mira como brilla tu piel

Estás dura

Dímelo, dímelo cómo es que es

Estás dura

Yo te doy un 20 de 10

Estás dura, dura, dura

 

Me gusta como mueve ese rampampam

Mi mente maquineando en un plan, plan, plan

Si me deja en esas curvas le doy pam-pam

Cuál es tu receta no sé, estás pa comerte bien

Me gusta como mueve ese rampampam

Mi mente maquineando en un plan, plan, plan

Si me deja en esas curvas le doy pam-pam

Tu belleza retumba, las otra pa la tumba

 

Uno, dos y tres

Vamos a darle, la envidia que se calle,

Saludo a todas las nenas, que paralizan la calle

Cómo tú te llamas, de dónde tú eres,

Dame el número, pa entrar contigo en detalle

Tienes el toque, toque, toque

Pareces una estrella, formando el alboroto

Tienes el toque, toque, toque

Se cae el internet cuando subes una foto

 

Cuando yo la vi, dije si esa mujer fuera para mí

Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura

 

Que estás dura,

Estás dura mamacita te fuiste de nivel

Yo te doy un 20 de 10

Estás dura, dura, dura

 

Tu tienes el size,

Otra como tú, mami no hay

Pégate dale boom bye, bye,

Que tu tienes el size,

Otra como tú, mami no hay

Bad Wolves - Zombie (Lyrics):

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eighteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eight-teen
In your head, in your head, they're dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie,

Oh oh oh oh

Lyrics:

You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

When you fall get up, oh oh
If you fall get up, eh eh

'Cause this is Africa

The song tells us a story about a young man, who decides to express himself throughout these words. He faced, disappointment, lies, pain, he was left behind by the woman he once loved, cared about and dedicated everything to. Deciding now to let go by closing this chapter and opening a new one, 
for a new beginning in his life

Lyrics:

[Verse 1 - Tomine Harket]:
We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Verse 2 - Au/Ra]:
Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

[Pre-chorus - Au/Ra]:
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side

[Chorus]:
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side

Lyrics:
Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Luther Vandross was a musical master whose style has influenced an entire generation of today's vocalists. His distinctive brand of satin smooth vocal magic moved international audiences and continues to touch people to this day. For almost 25 years, from 1981 to 2005, Luther Vandross dominated the American R&B music charts like no other artist before or since. In that span he released eight #1 R&B albums, seven #1 R&B singles and another five Top 20 R&B singles. He achieved crossover status with eight Billboard Top 10 albums, including reaching #1 with 2003's Dance With My Father; and another five Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 singles.""",16819,260,0,1,308930,2012-11-27 18:00:56,1,"dance with my father, music, vevo, songs, luthervandrossvevo, luther vandross music, luther vandross songs, singer, luther vandross singer, official, video, music video, single, album, contemporary r and b, Dance With My Father, J Records, Luther Vandross, Pop",Luther Vandross - Dance With My Father,wmDxJrggie8,57352851,CJYBEAA,w,0,12,11,27,332,1,7.7585550114751705,4.220317336168364,5.489860084416135,4.225800170570545,7,48,0.2956601731601732,232,0.047619047619047616,18,0.0,6,0,3,0,1,1,3,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,2,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,38,0.7075879563006824,0.5439566169120885,1.299129126514026,0,0,4.0

Po świetnym 2016r w wykonaniu Palucha ( dwa albumy - ""10/29"" platynowy i ""Ostatni Krzyk Osiedla"" podwójna platyna) raper nie zwalnia tempa i serwuje nam pierwszy singiel promujący kolejny album 
""ZŁOTA OWCA"" który trafi do sprzedaży już na jesień 2017r.
Tym razem jest to utwór na klimatycznym ale dynamicznym bicie Julasa, naczelnego producenta Palucha.
Numer skłania do refleksji nad codziennym pędem za pieniądzem oraz zwraca uwagę na często błędne priorytety wsród społeczeństwa. 

Album Paluch ""ZŁOTA OWCA"" zostanie wydany nakładem BOR Records.

For those curious, this film Includes footage of most of the concert, with four audio-only bonus tracks at the end.

This was not to chronicle the event like a documentary, but an attempt to provide a more impressionistic experience, and highlight enjoyment of the music footage by:

-- Removing the intra-song dialogue 
-- Trying to raise low bass (but it was really too muddy  there)
-- Bringing up high treble for ease to hear vocals/guitars 
-- Zooming in slightly to help fill out the frame
-- Using analog multi-band compressors to balance the sound.

Notes:

1. Including the intra-song dialogue didn't make as much sense since a.) the song order had to be reversed.b.) it's already available in other links. c.) IMO it highlights the intense emotional atmosphere -- the attempted goal on this video.

2. A very slight plate reverb was used on the John songs were his vocal was distorting and too forward in the mix.

3. It's a shame that on some of the Paul songs his mic is somewhat low. And John's rhythm guitar sounds great, but mixed a little loud. (It's nice to hear because it's usually more buried, but on this there was no way to easily correct it. I tried to bring up the frequencies a tad where Paul's voice was punching through, but there was a lot of overlap that made it hard.)

4. at 4:54 it appears as though the drummer is gone but that's just a drum kit from the previous band. Ringo is on a platform.

5. On a few songs the audio/video synch is slightly a few frames off -- because the original source was off. Most viewers don't notice or care; but if you watch the 2016 Ron H7oward feature you'll see it's off there too.   Apparently it was married together about 20 yrs ago from the video and soundboard recording.  I just got really tired with working on this and didn't notice. And also I never expected this video to be so popular since other versions have been around. Here's one that's closer to the original source footage:

Unfortunately YouTube doesn't allow for re-posting w/o losing views/comments.  Hopefully someday.   The back-half of the video is great though.  ;)
