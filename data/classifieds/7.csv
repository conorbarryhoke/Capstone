0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,567,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart completed his Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551, on 10 August 1788. It was the last symphony that he composed.
The work is nicknamed the Jupiter Symphony. This name stems not from Mozart but rather was likely coined by the impresario Johann Peter Salomon in an early arrangement for piano. The symphony is scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns in C, two trumpets in C, timpani in C and G, and strings. The 41st Symphony is the last of a set of three that Mozart composed in rapid succession during the summer of 1788. The 39th was completed 26 June and the 40th 25 July. Around the same time, Mozart was writing his piano trios in E and C major, his sonata facile, and a violin sonatina. It is not known whether the 41st Symphony was ever performed in the composer's lifetime. According to Otto Erich Deutsch, around this time Mozart was preparing to hold a series of ""Concerts in the Casino"" in a new casino in the Spiegelgasse owned by Philipp Otto. Mozart even sent a pair of tickets for this series to his friend Michael Puchberg. But it seems impossible to determine whether the concert series was held, or was cancelled for lack of interest. The four movements are arranged in the traditional symphonic form of the Classical era:
1. Allegro vivace, 4/4
2. Andante cantabile, 3/4 in F major
3. Menuetto: Allegretto - Trio, 3/4
4. Molto allegro, 2/2
In an article about the Jupiter Symphony, Sir George Grove wrote that ""it is for the finale that Mozart has reserved all the resources of his science, and all the power, which no one seems to have possessed to the same degree with himself, of concealing that science, and making it the vehicle for music as pleasing as it is learned. Nowhere has he achieved more."" Of the piece as a whole, he wrote that ""It is the greatest orchestral work of the world which preceded the French Revolution."" Scholars are certain Mozart studied Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 28 in C major, which also has a fugato in its finale. Charles Sherman speculates that Mozart also studied the younger Haydn's Symphony No. 39 in C major because he ""often requested his father Leopold to send him the latest fugue that Haydn had written."" The Michael Haydn No. 39, written only a few weeks before Mozart's, also has a fugato in the finale, the theme of which begins with two whole notes. Sherman has pointed out other similarities between the two almost perfectly contemporaneous works. The four-note motif is also the main theme of the contrapuntal finale of Michael's elder brother Joseph's Symphony No. 13 in D major (1764).

Wilhelm Kempff, piano (Live)

The Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor, Op. 31, No. 2, was composed in 1801/02 by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is usually referred to as ""The Tempest"" (or Der Sturm in his native German), but this title was not given by him, or indeed referred to as such during his lifetime; instead, it comes from a claim by his associate Anton Schindler that the sonata was inspired by the Shakespeare play. However, much of Schindler's information is distrusted by classical music scholars. Renowned British music scholar, Donald Francis Tovey, in his authoritative book A Companion to Beethoven's Pianoforte Sonatas, states that ""The story that Beethoven connected this sonata with The Tempest is evidently one of many such inventions by his biographer Anton Schindler"". The third movement, in the key of D minor, is very moving, first flowing with emotion and then reaching a climax, before moving into an extended development section which mainly focuses on the opening figure of the movement, reaching a climax at measures 169-173. The recapitulation is preceded by an extensive cadenza-like passage of sixteenth notes for the right hand and the coda which follows is quite substantial, reaching what can be considered the climax of the movement at measure 381, a fortissimo falling chromatic scale.

LYRICS:
I’m cornered, in fire, so break out the secrets
I hope you know, that you were worth it all along
I’m tired, you’re angry and everyone looks blurry
I love you, I’m leaving so long
 
Hey little one
I’m so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
My little one
 
The places I took you, they seem so fucking empty
I have trouble going anywhere at all
Especially my own bedroom, it stays awake to haunt me
So pass out, black out, drunk in another bathroom stall
 
Hey little one
I’m so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only friend
How long must I talk about my pain through these songs
How long, how long…
 
Hey little one
I’m so scared of what this could have been
I know that today I lost my only little one

How long must I talk about my pain through these songs
How long, how long

“I did the slow version and I wanted it out as a single: as a statement of The Beatles’ position on Vietnam and The Beatles’ position on revolution. For years, on The Beatles’ tours, Brian Epstein had stopped us from saying anything about Vietnam or the war.” - John Lennon.

“Plugging directly into the Abbey Road desk and pushing the needles into the red achieved the fuzz-guitar sound.  According to George Martin “We got into distortion on that, which we had a lot of complaints from the technical people about.  But that was the idea: it was John’s song and the idea was to push it right to the limit.  Well, we went to the limit and beyond.”

“Revolution"" was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and filmed on the 4th September 1968 at Twickenham Film Studios.

I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well he just drove off sometimes life's OK
I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did I say
Well you just laughed it off it was all OK

And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on any way

Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand
Bad news comes don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well we'll float on good news is on the way

And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK

Someone (I can't remember who) had the idea that we re-visit, re-edit the entire album for posterity’s sake. We got as far as the first track before we couldn't be arsed anymore and gave up….it does sound fucking mega though!”

A church cantata by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), with the cantata chorale based on the Lutheran hymn ""Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme"" (""Sleepers awake, the voice is calling"") by Philipp Nicolai. The text is based on the Parable of the Ten Virgins in Matthew 25:1-13, the reading of which is scheduled for the 27th Sunday after Trinity in the Lutheran lectionary. This cantata was first performed in Leipzig on November 25, 1731. Bach later transcribed the fourth movement chorale for organ (BWV 645) and published it along with the Schübler Chorales.

English text:


I. (Chorus)

Wake ye maids! hard, strikes the hour,
The watchman calls high on the tower,
Awake, awake, Jerusalem.
Midnight strikes, hear, hear it sounding,
Loud cries the watch, with call resounding:
Where are ye, o wise virgins, where?
Good cheer, the Bridegroom come,
Arise and take your lamps!
Alleluja!
Ye maids beware:
The feast prepare,
So go ye forth to meet Him there.

II. Recitative:

He comes.
The Bridegroom comes!
And Zion's daughter shall rejoice,
He hastens to her dwelling claiming
The maiden of his choice.
The Bridegroom comes; as is a roebuck,
Yea, like a lusty mountain roebuck,
Fleet and fair,
His marriage feast he bids you share.
Arise and take your lamps!
In eagerness to greet him;
Come! hasten, sally forth to meet him.

III. Aria (Duet)

[Soul] Come quickly, now come.
[Jesus] Yea quickly I come.
[Soul] We wait thee with lamps all alighted!
The doors open wide,
Come claim me my bride!
[Jesus] The doors open wide,
I claim me my bride.
[Soul] Come quickly!
[Jesus] Forever in rapture united

IV. Chorale

Zion hears the watchmen calling,
The Faithful hark with joy enthralling,
They rise and haste to greet their Lord.
See, He comes, the Lord victorious,
Almighty, noble, true and glorious,
In Heav'n supreme, on earth adored.
Come now, Thou Holy One,
The Lord Jehovah's Son!
Alleluja!
We follow all
The joyful call
To join Him in the Banquet Hall!

V. Recitative

So come thou unto me,
My fair and chosen bride,
Thou whom I long to see
Forever by my side.
Within my heart of hearts
Art thou secure by ties that naught can sever,
Where I may cherish thee forever.
Forget, beloved, ev'ry care,
Away with pain and grief and sadness,
For better or for worse to share
Our lives in love and joy and gladness.

VI. Aria (Duet)

[Soul] Thy love is mine,
[Jesus] And I am thine!
[Both] True lovers ne'er are parted.
[Soul] Now I with thee, and thou with me.
[Jesus] In flow'ry field will wander,
[Both] In rapture united forever to be.

VII. Chorale

Gloria sing all our voices,
With Angels all mankind rejoices,
With harp and strings in sweetest tone.
Twelve bright Pearls adorn Thy Portals,
As Angels round Thy glorious Throne.
No ear has ever heard
The joy we know.
Our praises flow,
Eeo, eeo,
To God in dulci jubilo.


Text of the Parable of the Ten Virgins:


Matthew 25:1-13 (WEB)

'Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, ""Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!"" Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, ""Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."" But the wise answered, saying, ""What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves."" While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ""Lord, Lord, open to us."" But he answered, ""Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you."" Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.'

- Andante grazioso (a theme with six variations)
- Menuetto (a minuet and trio) 
- Alla Turca (Allegretto in A minor and major)

It is uncertain where and when Mozart composed the sonata; however, Vienna or Salzburg around 1783 is currently thought to be most likely. The last movement, Alla Turca, popularly known as the Turkish Rondo or Turkish March, is often heard on its own and is one of Mozart's best-known piano pieces.

After the video of Laidback Luke, Steve Aoki, and Sander van Doorn from a festival went viral, where all 3 were ""DJing"" together, and Art Department criticized them for it, and someone made a similar video of them to a make them eat their words, I thought it would be fun to show people what DJs REALLY do, or what they SHOULD be doing instead of playing air guitar, twiddling knobs necessarily, or generally doing the same thing the crowd is doing but in the DJ booth.

Oh money hi black aa
Dil ton taan sache aan
Naagni shakeedi bhora
Chitte kolon bache aan

Bohateyan na maahde biba
Bohateyan naal ache aa
Jinne vi aan badle gaddar badle

Gabru na simple vichar badle
Teeje din, teeje din car badle
Kare je chalakiyan te naar badle
Na na by god kade nahio yaar badle

Change ho giyan gallan baliye
Change ho gaya samaa kude
Change ho giyan kudiyan badiyan
Yaar ni badle jamaa kude
Nah!

Laine aan sawad pehlan si ni tangiyan
Gehdi laun layi Ggddiyan ni mangiyan
Sehliyan de order’an ton kitte bachde
Yaara diyan yaariyan ne boht changiyan

Badle tareeke bande thokne kivein
Bapu de na ditte hathyar badle

Gabru na simple vichar badle
Teeje din, teeje din car badle
Kare je chalakiyan te naar badle
Na na by god kade nahio yaar badle

Oh rees ni hundi kaiyan ton ni

Uchche ud’de jehde saale
Thalle aaun ton darde aa

Sheran warge yaar ae rakhi

Pistol bande jehde saale
Challan ton aen darde aa

Ho yaari ch gaddariyan na raas jattan nu
Ranna naalo ganna bahut khaas jattan nu
Yaaran nu koyi manda changa banda bolda
Chakk laiye tel ohnu laake pattan nu

Yaari badle jaan ditti ae
Badle munh talwar’an de
Esse gallon yaar rehnde aa

TRACKLIST
1. B - Ambush 
2. B - Elite 
3. B - Kreuzberg 

INFO
1 MAN, 4 MACHINES - B is the new live Techno project from Bert Libeert of GOOSE. Armed with just two synths and two drum machines B is bringing the rawness and spontaneity of live music back to clubs. His signature sound is an uncompromising mix of hard edged EBM and Old School Techno that still sounds as exciting today as when it first kicked off a musical revolution in the 1980s.
His first EP, ""AMBUSH”, will be released on the pioneering Techno/Electro label Lektroluv and wastes no time in setting out its stall. From the minute the needle hits the record ‘Ambush’ goes in hard, jackhammer beats and aggressive synth riffs that will tear the roof off any club.

With ‘Elite’, B drops the tempo in the best Belgian style, grinding out the kind of Industrial sounds that first put the country on the electronic music map. Finally ‘Kreuzberg’ pays homage to the Berlin neighbourhood the EP was recorded in, its distorted acidic blasts and relentless beats the perfect soundtrack to a night out in Europe’s Techno capital.

A respected producer/musician, Bert Libeert is best known for drumming with GOOSE (Skint/!K7/Safari Records) but in recent years has also produced and worked on several other projects including co-writing ""You're Mine"", 2015’s Gold-selling single from Raving George & Oscar And The Wolf.

Alongside releasing his new EP B is also hosting B - NIGHTS, a series of parties held in out of the way and unusual spots from fairgrounds to swimming pools and galleries. Keep an eye
on his Facebook page for updates.

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows...

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me, how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now what we've got

My loneliness is killing me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign

For the many who witnessed The Beatles’ early appearances on British television, this song is synonymous with those exciting era–defining times. The power of the band’s performances and the recording owes so much to John’s searing vocal. For their debut album, John recorded his vocal in one take at the end of a marathon recording session on February 11th 1963.  

In July 1963, ‘Twist And Shout’ became the title track of the band’s first EP to be released in the UK. According to the advert on the front of New Musical Express, it was “The record you’ve been asking for”. A week after Twist And Shout was released it made the EP best-seller list and a week after that topped the same chart staying there for ten weeks. This clip was videotaped in the middle of a six-night run at the Odeon Cinema in Llandudno, North Wales.",3103,169,0,1,133293,2016-04-08 07:00:01,0,"The Beatles, Beatles, Twist And Shout, Anthology Streaming Week, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Billboard Hot 100 Chart",The Beatles - Twist & Shout - Performed Live On The Ed Sullivan Show 2/23/64,b-VAxGJdJeQ,22066219,CKwCEAA,b,0,16,4,8,99,4,7.343727924094575,3.7693034601890822,5.124807342653186,3.4917817755841662,7,14,0.13522727272727272,178,0.25,8,0.13636363636363635,14,0,2,0,0,2,7,1,0,4,3,0,0,3,1,2,3,0,0,2,2,3,2,2,2,0,0,0,76,0.6978482040216699,0.513268397079649,1.4676768687229371,0,1,7.0

For more than ten years, the ensemble has developed and refined its singular approach to improvisation and composition, through cross-disciplinary projects with film, collaborations with improvising instrumentalists at home and abroad, study of repertoire by like-minded composer-improvisers, and immersion in the improvised-composed musical worlds of masters Wadada Leo Smith, Anthony Braxton, Cecil Taylor, Henry Threadgill, and others.

Lyrics:

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

Good evening, everyone! ^_^
I really hope you are doing well! I have been quite busy the last couple of months, but I have still been making music. I often start to work on new pieces before I finish the old ones, so I currently have a lot of unfinished pieces and songs. I hope to release some of them in the nearest future!

The idea behind this piece was to create relaxing music that could be used as background music for meditation and sleep. I have decided to call it ""Serenity"" and it features soft rhythms, strings, flute, piano and more.

Warm wishes to all of you, 
Peder B. Helland

Hello again, everyone! :-)
I hope you are doing well! Here's a new relaxing music piece that I have composed, called ""Ocean Whisper"". The main instruments are piano, flute & cello. I also added some ocean waves to the piece.

I have not uploaded anything new here lately, but I have composed quite regularly so I hope to release more content (in different genres as well) in the near future. 

Thank you very much for watching, sharing and leaving feedback. 

See you soon,

LYRICS
Now I'm of consenting age to be forgetting you in a cabaret.
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen may even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's P.A.
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified peach and lime daiquiri

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety

But, but I'm afraid that I
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

Well, I'm afraid that I
Well, that's right, well I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety

Well, I'm afraid that I
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

Suspense music, called ""Flow"". The song features creepy horror sound effects with a morphing background. The intention was to create a moody, dark and creepy atmosphere which could fit in eerie scenes. Instruments included are among others: music box, creepy voice, piano, eerie atmospheric sounds, horror sound effects, scary violin, dark cello and deep, mysterious choir. I hope you enjoy!

„Egzotyka” to drugi, po pokrytej platyną „Ezoteryce”, album studyjny Quebonafide. 

„Egzotykę” wyróżnia niewątpliwie koncepcja. Krążek powstał podczas podróży po świecie, a każdy z 14 utworów inspirowany jest innym miejscem na Ziemi. Pomimo jasnego motywu przewodniego, tracklista „Egzotyki” jest bardzo różnorodna: od emocjonalnych i osobistych kawałków, po świeże i nowoczesne bangery. 

W swoich utworach, Quebonafide porusza tematy związane nie tylko z kulturą i atmosferą odwiedzanych miejsc, ale również problemami społecznymi. Obecność międzynarodowych gości dodaje płycie autentyczności i wyjątkowego klimatu.

Za produkcję utworu ""C'est la Vie"" odpowiada Wrotas LifeView,  za zdjęcia i montaż odpowiedzialna jest ekipa H D S C V M.

I.   Pezzo i forma di sonatina: Andante non troppo; Allegro moderato

Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings in C major, Op. 48, premiered in 1880, remains today one of the late Romantic era's most definitive compositions.

In his score, Tchaikovsky supposedly wrote, ""The larger the string orchestra, the better will the composer's desires be fulfilled.""

Serenade for Strings has 4 movements:

I.   Pezzo i forma di sonatina: Andante non troppo; Allegro moderato; this was an homage to Mozart 
II.  Valse: Moderato; Tempo di valse 
III. Élégie: Larghetto elegiaco 
IV.  Finale (Tema russo): Andante; Allegro con spirito

An almost cathartically intense performance of Schumann’s most important large-scale piano work, and one of the most important in the entire period.

The Op.17 Fantasy is remarkable for many reasons – the bedazzling variety of its textures, its addictive quirkiness (Schumann probably had the most acute sense of the fantastic among all the Romantic composers), its expressive power (especially in the uplifting final movement). But one feature not often noticed is the structural complexity of the first movement, which represents Schumann’s most successful engagement with sonata form. 

The biggest mystery of the first movement is the notorious Im Legendenton [04:43], which though beautiful seems to constitute a massive disruption of the development section [which begins at 03:09], apparently unconnected as it is to the rest of the movement. In fact, the Im Legendenton is a direct outgrowth the inner-voice theme at [0:59], and a nice example of Schumann’s skill at conjuring new material out of apparently nothing. Nonetheless, the Im Legendenton is not at all a conventional episode in a development section: the development is meant to be unstable, and to be open-ended – it prepares for the arrival of the tonic and the recapitulation. But the Im Legendenton’s structure is too well-formed, its tonality too stable, and its posture too inward-looking to count as a development per se. 

There are other structural tricks going on here too: the recapitulation [which begins at 08:03 in the wrong key of C minor] directly invokes the beginning of the development(!) section [at 10:08] to firmly re-establish the tonality of C major, an unusual step that Schumann also takes in his other sonatas. It’s an ingenious and natural gesture, despite its apparent oddness: given how prominent the development is in the movement, it seems fitting that the recapitulation expands to encompass material from the development section. There’s also the fact that the opening theme begins a pedal point on G that is never properly resolved until the perfectly cadence coming nearly 300 bars later – a nice instance of long-term harmonic tension and resolution. (This is a feature of the Op.17 as a whole – a progression with a clear harmonic goal is introduced, only for that goal to be sidestepped and delayed to a much further point.)

It’s also worth noting that a lot of the structural complexity of the first movement is mirrored in the last. Take its opening: we’ve got this tranquil four-bar curtain, and then 6 bars introducing the main melody. And as soon as this melody ends we get some pretty aggressive developmental treatment of the first two bars of the melody [starting at 20:02] which seems out-of-place coming so early in the movement. And then – what appears to have been such a promising theme simply vanishes. It will be some time, in fact before the main thematic material is directly presented.

There’s a lot more at work here: the sly references between each movement, for e.g., or the ingenuity of the first movement’s development section. But it’s basically impossible to get it all down here, so just listening will have to do – though that’s not too bad, surely.",42,1774,0,0,1515,2016-10-14 19:37:49,0,"Schumann, Fantasie in C major, Op.17, Fantasy in C major, Andsnes, Piano, Classical Music, Romantic, Score, Sheet Music, Scrolling, Melody, Virtuoso, Difficult","Schumann: Fantasie in C, Op.17 (Andsnes)",XZ7hE4lQAYs,190006,CMgBEAA,c,0,16,10,14,288,4,5.278767315298873,2.130333768495006,3.1804126328383235,1.6232492903979006,5,41,0.1870433000641334,536,-0.075,13,0.0,5,0,3,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,40,0.6024915369201597,0.403566522494919,1.9592878627156043,0,1,7.0

Yeu La Tha Thu Lyrics: 

Trong kí ức anh khi ấy 
Lần đầu gặp gỡ làm tim nhớ nhung 
Rồi từng ngày trôi qua 
Trong thâm tâm bỗng chốc nhận ra ấm áp tràn về mỗi lúc 
Khi em đến ngày hôm ấy 
Một người đang đứng gần ngay kế bên vội cầm bàn tay em 
Lôi đi nhanh trước mắt của anh lúc đấy...mờ dần rồi biến mất... 
Rồi nhiều lần khi anh thấy em cười 
Nhiều lần nước mắt rơi xuống ướt nhòa 
Dặn lòng mạnh mẽ đi kế bên và muốn nói ""Đừng buồn một người không nhớ đến ta"" 

Tình yêu như món quà, khi có nhau đừng quên là 
Từng vui khóc cùng nhau mà cớ sao ta vội muôn cách xa!? 
Tình yêu vỡ tan cứ quay đầu lại phía sau 
xem ai đã đang kề cạnh ta bên lúc đau!? 
Tình yêu sao khác thường 
Đôi lúc ta thật kiên cường 
Nhiều người trách mình điên cuồng 
Cứ lao theo dù không lối ra 
Một khi đã yêu trái tim bằng lòng thứ tha cho quá khứ hai ta cùng đi qua",17209,338,0,1,225941,2017-04-12 14:00:00,0,"y1 music, yeah1 music offcial, bài hát hay, nhạc hot, nhạc trẻ, nhac tre hay, nhac hay, nhac tre moi nhat, ca nhac tre, nhac tre hay nhat hien nay, nhạc trẻ 2017, yeu la tha thu, only c, tha thu, em chua 18, ost, nhac phim, Will 365, Kaity Nguyen, Chau Bui, nhac phim Viet Nam, yêu là tha thu only c, yêu là tha thu only c em chưa 18 ost, em chưa 18 ost, nhạc phim em chưa 18, yeu la tha thu only c, yêu là tha thu, yeu la tha thu only c em chua 18, Em Chưa 18 Movie OST","Yêu Là ""Tha Thu"" | Only C | Em Chưa 18 OST | Official Music Video",-nnWBhKZeg0,111917647,CPoBEAA,c,0,17,4,12,102,2,8.048898570804193,4.162086240240853,5.35399504658254,4.2357556345867176,8,15,0.5,233,0.04166666666666666,28,0.0,15,0,3,0,2,1,1,2,0,3,4,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,65,0.6651835651157426,0.5171000980603742,1.2639999821672736,0,0,7.0

“E sei un particolare/dentro il quadro generale/che vorrebbero ma non possono ignorare”. “C’ è sempre una canzone”, brano scritto da Ligabue e già inciso da Luca Carboni, è il singolo che precede l’uscita dell’album live “Giro del mondo” in uscita il prossimo 14 aprile; questo videoclip ufficiale anticipa i contenuti del dvd, in una girandola di immagini che raccontano la dimensione ""epica"" dei grandi stadi italiani, così come la prima volta di Ligabue oltreoceano, acclamato in Canada, nei teatri e club di New York, San Francisco, Miami e Los Angeles, fino ad arrivare a cornici più “esotiche” nelle venue di San Paolo del Brasile e Shanghai con tappe anche in Argentina, Giappone e Australia.

0,Ashish Xiangyi Kumar,689,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"This is one of Beethoven's most important works, often classed with the Appassionata and Les Aideux as one of the great sonatas of his middle period. There is too much to say about the structural/harmonic innovations of this piece, but I suppose the most notable features about it are the extended modulation to the mediant (E major) in the first movement (the same modulation also features prominently in one of the most important late sonatas, the Hammerklavier), the linking of the first movement's 1st and 2nd themes via a 5-note falling motif, and the daring (not to say virtuosic) textures of the final rondo.

Movement I: 00:00
Movement II: 10:30
Movement III: 14:14*

Pletnev's performance is incredibly lively and buoyant -- check out the Rondo, where he thankfully avoids the overpedaling that even other great pianists end up doing (Beethoven's long sustained pedal marks, which ignore changes of harmony, were appropriate on the dry instruments of his time, but are clearly out of place on the modern grand, with its rich sonorities and lush sustaining pedal.) It's always nice to hear a performance of a Beethoven sonata that its not wearingly overserious, and is willing to pull on the structure a bit to emphasise ""in-the-moment"" textures (see 20:40) -- although by any measure this is a very serious performance of a very important part of the piano literature.",261,1426,0,0,11821,2014-06-02 12:58:27,0,"Mikhail Pletnev (Performer), Piano Sonata No.21 (Composition), Ludwig Van Beethoven (Author), Waldstein, Sonata (Composition Type), Russian, Piano, Sonata, Fast, Keyboard, Romantic, Rondo, Score, Sheet Music, Scrolling, Horowitz, Arau, Arrau, Argerich, Barenboim, Piano Sonatas, Nodame Cantabile (TV Program), Modulation, C Major, Liszt, Chopin, Calming, Melody, Classical music, Virtuoso","Beethoven: Sonata No.21 in C Major, ""Waldstein"" (Pletnev)",lbblMw6k1cU,1822968,CKwCEAA,c,0,14,6,2,153,0,6.260779045207144,2.8382192219076257,4.072654217333033,2.416640507338281,6,23,0.24902698863636366,223,0.052500000000000005,29,0.0625,7,0,4,0,0,1,6,0,0,1,2,1,0,2,0,5,4,0,0,1,1,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,57,0.6505027869416347,0.4533332355947597,1.6852544699826737,0,0,7.0

With style and energy to spare, unparalleled musicianship and a natural comedic flair, he is one of a kind.

His newest CD, ""INFLUENCES"" a musical journey of self re-discovery, offers a palate of moods and flavors born of life experiences, challenges, and the effect of the people past and present who have helped shape and mold his sound, and promises to give fans more of what they expect from the talented Colionne.

*======================================*
You don't answer the phone anymore
And it's hanging by a thread some hope of mine
I never thought that I'd lose my mind for you
You unexpectedly escaped
Leaving a void in this life of mine
Without answers for me because things of yours remain

There's no...there's no perfume  of your skin
There's no...breathing of yours in the face
There's not...your strawberry mouth
There's not...the sweet honey of your hair
There's not...the poison in your heart
There's no... way out for this love
There's no...there's no life for me, but
there's no...there's no other reason that sets my soul free.

Enchanted in a night of madness
Even in jail I'd walk into for you
Just one life is not enough...for me
If even summer has its clouds
you are a hurricane opposed to me
Ripping the dreams in my day that's  passing quickly, because

There's not...the poison in your heart
There's no... way out for this love
There's no...there's no life for me, but
there's no...there's no other reason for me

If there's a God, He can't forget me, even if there's a really dark sky  between Him and me.
I'll beg, I'll look for you, and I swear, I'll find you
Even If I have to live for another thousand hundreds years.
In this life of darkness without you, I feel that , until now, you became the only reason for me
If there's a obstacle in this love, I swear I'll get through it
this huge vain done by the endless days, I'll love you
As in the first time at your house
all of your gestures has got me out of my mind
I felt like loosing myself inside of you.

There's no...there's no perfume  of your skin
There's no...breathing of yours in the face
There's not...your strawberry mouth
There's not...the sweet honey of your hair

Some Info:
Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687)
Italian-born composer (French nationality from 1681). Entered service of Louis XIV 1653, composed instrumental music for the court ballets. From 1664 collaborated with Molière in series of comedy-ballets which were forerunners of French opera, the last and most famous being Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, in which Lully danced role of the Mufti.

Having assimilated both Italian and French styles and tastes, from 1673 he turned to opera composition and obtained from the King exclusive rights to arrange operatic performances in Paris.

Lyrics:

This is the greatest and best song in the world... Tribute.

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon... in the middle... of the road.
And he said:
[Sung]
Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul. (soul)
[Spoken]
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
and we each said... Okay.
[Sung]
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,

หากนับจากวันที่เธอ ที่เธอเคยปราบใจ ฉันจึงพึงระลึก ระลึกว่าตราบใด 
จะไม่ทำให้เธอ ให้เธอลำบากใจ ขอให้เธอไม่สน ไม่สนลมปากใคร
จะมีแต่วันพรุ่งนี้ พรุ่งนี้ตลอดไป  เพราะฉันจะไม่วิ่งหนี วิ่งหนีแล้วจากไป!

Lyrics:

High above the mucky-muck, castle made of clouds,
There sits Wonderboy, sitting oh so proudly.
Not much to say when you're high above the mucky-muck.
Yeah, yeah.
Wonderboy, what is the secret of your power?
Wonderboy, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man?

Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman,
archrival and nemesis of Wonderboy, with powers comparable to Wonderboy.
What powers you ask? I dunno how 'bout the power of flight?
That do anything for ya? That's levitation, holmes.
How 'bout the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away...
with mind bullets! That's telekinesis, Kyle.
How 'bout the power to move you?

History of Wonderboy and Young Nastyman,
Riggah-goo-goo, riggah-goo-goo.
A secret to be told, a gold chest to be bold,
And blasting forth with three-part harmony, yeow!
Wonderboy, what is the secret of your power?
Wonderboy, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man?",851,272,0,1,26342,2010-10-20 01:27:36,1,"Tenacious D, beelzeboss, Epic, the metal, guitar lesson, Tenacious D live, hq, official, cover, karaoke, download, music, playlist, classico, kickapoo, audio, lyrics, live, music video, Wonderboy live, vevo, Sony, Tenacious D lyrics, Rock, TenaciousDVevo, pick of destiny, album, acoustic, Wonderboy, official video, stairway to heaven, single, instrumental, wonderboy, master exploder, Tenacious D Wonderboy, hd, live dave grohl, rize, of, the",Tenacious D - Wonderboy,FL4HSiGvk68,4520445,CGQQAA,d,0,10,10,20,293,2,6.655181189575026,3.4222614508136027,4.420648745416557,2.929929560084588,6,42,0.1478703703703704,198,0.09567099567099567,40,0.0,3,0,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,23,0.6642416817052642,0.5142251357745731,1.5087901107386794,0,0,7.0

Back to Qlimax 2016, where Ran-D was the surprise act. That’s when a large audience heard Zombie for the first time. Ran-D opened the set with this sound explosion, and from then on it hasn’t stopped. The audience response is amazing wherever it's played. It was the perfect opener for X-Qlusive Ran-D, his solo event in AFAS Live that was completely sold out. It’s not just a Dutch phenomenon, because Zombie sets dance floors on fire all around the world.

Attention to miniscule details, translating intense emotions into sound and striving for the highest standard have been lifelong values that Hardstyle pioneer Ran-D possesses. As one of the most thorough, yet down-to-Earth figures in the Hard Dance industry, Randy Wieland’s knowledge extends into all aspects of production as his enthusiasm and drive shines throughout all of his creations.",3815,242,0,0,133633,2017-08-14 10:00:00,0,"Ran-D, Gunz For Hire, Hardstyle, Zombie, Roughstate, Out Now, Q-Dance, Qlimax, cranberries",Ran-D - Zombie [official videoclip],8ga_tSyiRvQ,12696727,CJYBEAA,d,0,17,8,14,226,0,7.1036917816618,3.475235222604128,5.125913718230724,3.5814945422908995,7,33,0.2294877344877345,163,0.0,8,0.0,4,0,2,1,2,1,2,2,0,0,5,0,0,2,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,35,0.7215844768861293,0.4892153727130247,1.4312219822487682,0,0,7.0

Parla dell'Irlanda, la mia isola preferita, dove non sono mai stato e che un giorno desidero visitare. Una terra magica avvolta di cielo e circondata di oceano dove si nascondono i lepricani, dove gli arcobaleni si rincorrono, dove la gente è cordialissima e sempre sorridente, dove ci si perde fra castelli e fantastiche scogliere e dove ci si diverte ascoltando musica dal vivo nei pub color legno. 

Ricorda sempre di dimenticare
le cose che ti hanno reso triste.
Ma non dimenticate mai di ricordare
le cose che ti hanno reso felice.

The project was a collaborative effort between the band's namesake James ""D. Train"" Williams, who was featured as the lead vocalist and songwriter, and Hubert Eaves III, a keyboardist and producer who performed the instrumentation on the recordings. Hailing from Brooklyn, New York, Williams himself was a R&B/dance producer as well. He and Eaves met during high school and began performing together. Eaves would spend most of the 1970s as a member of the R&B band Mtume. However, by the 1980s, he and Williams had teamed up again. The group named themselves ""D. Train"" after a nickname Williams had acquired as a football player in high school.
D. Train released their first single ""You're the One For Me"" in late 1981. The track became an instant success, hitting #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart that year; it has been remixed and re-released successfully several times since, and was contemporaneously covered by Paul Hardcastle with vocalist Kevin Henry in the United Kingdom. The duo's self-titled debut album (which prominently featured the ""You're the One For Me"" title on the front cover, and the album sometimes became known by this name) followed in early 1982, and several additional singles from this effort were successful on both the R&B and Dance charts, although they were not as popular as the debut hit. Among these tracks were ""Keep On,"" which reached #2 on the Dance chart, and a cover version of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David penned ""Walk On By"", that owed more to the Isaac Hayes version than to Dionne Warwick's original recording.
In 1983, the band released their follow-up album, Music. The title track became another dance-floor anthem and is the most gospel infused of D-Train's floor fillers.[citation needed] This track nearly equalled the success of the group's debut single. Several other singles from the album were moderately successful.
In 1984, D. Train had their only Billboard Hot 100 entry with ""Something's On Your Mind,"" which climbed to #79 and was later covered by Miles Davis on his album You're Under Arrest. The single also cracked the top five on the R&B chart, becoming the group's biggest hit in that market as well. The accompanying album, also titled Something's On Your Mind, found the band branching out into new musical territory, incorporating elements of reggae and more adult contemporary-oriented R&B into their music.[1] Williams himself played acoustic guitar on a cover of Carole King's ""So Far Away"".
A Greatest Hits album entitled You're the One for Me- The Very Best of D'Train was issued in several European countries in 1985 [1]. Featured on this compilation was a remixed version of ""You're the One for Me,"" and the tune charted a second time that year. The remixing on this version of the song was done by Paul Hardcastle, who had previously issued a cover version of the song, and by 1985 had become well-known for his own hit ""19"". Despite this success, the group would disband that same year.",997,401,0,1,20240,2011-09-02 21:08:25,0,"train, music, 80s, funk, keep, on",D Train - Keep On,qY1RvCU0rII,2870259,CPoBEAA,d,0,11,9,2,245,4,6.4579210873945145,3.1044871113123946,4.306210508167761,2.9986951583116563,6,35,0.2356619769119769,523,0.0,5,0.0,4,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0.6668106422937303,0.4807254640153738,1.4360280991657288,0,1,7.0

(Rough English translation)

If love was enough...

I dream of his face, I decline his body
And I imagine him living in my decor
I would have so much to tell him if I had known how to talk to him
How can I make him read my thoughts?

But how do the others who succeed all the time?
Tell me my errors, my dreams too
I would offer my soul, my heart and all my time
But even if I give it all, all is not enough

If loving each other was enough, if loving was enough
If we would change things a bit, only by loving giving away
If loving each other was enough, if loving was enough
I would do a dream of this world, an eternity

I have blood in my dreams, a dried petal
When tears are gnawing at me that others shed
Life isn't waterproof, my island is under the wind
Doors let shouts come in even when shutting them off

J.S.Bach  HARPSICHORD Concerto in D Minor BWV 1052 Polina Osetinskaya piano
The Mariinsky String Orchestra / Conductor: Anton Gakkel (2015) 
0:05 - 1mvt / 8:15 - 2mvt / 16:13 - 3mvt 
The life of pianist Polina Osetinskaya can be divided into two stages. The first – that of “wunderkind” (a word that Polina herself cannot abide) – was when Polina performed as a girl in huge halls filled with excited sensationalists. The second, which has continued to the present day, is essentially her victory over the first. It is both a reference to serious performing and to exacting audiences.
Polina Osetinskaya began to perform at the age of five. At the age of seven she entered the Central School of Music of the Moscow Conservatoire. Polina gave her first concert at the age of six at the Great Hall of the Vilnius Conservatoire in Lithuania. Together with her father who accepted the role of manager, the young Polina began to undertake frequent tours throughout the former USSR to packed halls and ovations. In her own country Polina was possibly the most famous child of her time and her relationship with her father was portrayed by the mass media as some kind of soap opera after the thirteen-year-old Polina decided to leave her father and study music seriously at the school of the Leningrad Conservatoire under the acclaimed teacher Marina Wolf.
Polina began to tour once again while still a student at the St Petersburg Conservatoire. (The pianist subsequently completed a postgraduate course at the Moscow Conservatoire under Professor Vera Gornostayeva.) She has appeared with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Weimar National Opera, the Academic Symphony Orchestra of the St Petersburg Philharmonic (Honoured Ensemble of Russia), the State Academic Svetlanov Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Virtuosi and the New Russia orchestra among other ensembles.
Polina Osetinskaya’s onstage partners have included conductors Saulius Sondeckis, Vassily Sinaisky, Andrei Boreiko, Gerd Albrecht, Yan Pascal Tortelier and Thomas Sanderling. Polina Osetinskaya has performed at the Wallonie Festival in Brussels, the Mainly Mozart festival, the Frédéric Chopin Festival in Miami, the Stars of the White Nights festival and the December Evenings festival among numerous others.
The pianist has been awarded the Maly Triumph prize. In 2008 she wrote her autobiography Farewell, Sadness, which became a bestseller.
Polina Osetinskaya generally creates unusual and frequently paradoxical solo programmes. She almost always includes works by contemporary composers, frequently justaposing them with traditional classical works: “Contemporary music is not just a continuation of older music. It also helps us discover ideas and beauty in older music that have been lost over decades of the blind museum generation and mechanical and often soulless performing.”
Polina Osetinskaya often performs works by post-avant-garde composers such as Valentin Silvestrov, Leonid Desyatnikov, Vladimir Martynov, Georgs Pelēcis and Pavel Karmanov.

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,2174,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448 is a piano work composed in 1781 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, at 25 years of age. It is written in strict sonata-allegro form, with three movements. The sonata was composed for a performance he would give with fellow pianist Josephine von Aurnhammer. Mozart composed this in the galant style, with interlocking melodies and simultaneous cadences. This is one of his only formal compositions written exclusively for two pianos. This sonata was also used in the scientific study that tested the theory of the Mozart Effect, suggesting that classical music increases brain activity more positively than other kinds of music. The sonata is written in three movements,
1. Allegro con spirito
2. Andante
and 3. Molto Allegro.
The first movement begins in D major, and sets the tonal center with a strong introduction. The two pianos divide the main melody for the exposition, and when the theme is presented both play it simultaneously. Mozart spends little time in the development introducing a new theme unlike most sonata forms, and begins the recapitulation, repeating the first theme. The entire second movement is played Andante, in a very relaxed pace. The melody is played with both pianos, but there is no strong climax in this movement. It is written in a strict ABA form. Molto Allegro begins with a galloping theme. The cadences used in this movement are similar to those in Mozart's Rondo alla Turca. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that Mozart's K 448 can have the ""Mozart effect"", in that listening to the piano sonata improved spatial reasoning skills and reduce the number of seizures in people with epilepsy. Apart from another Mozart Concerto, K 488, only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect, a song by the Greek composer Yanni, entitled ""Acroyali/Standing In Motion"", which is featured on his album Yanni Live at the Acropolis.  It was determined to have the ""Mozart effect"", by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine because it was similar to Mozart's K 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.

A slightly older contemporary of Antonio Vivaldi, Marcello held concerts at his hometown of Venice. He composed and published several sets of concertos, including six concertos under the title of La Cetra (The Lyre), as well as cantatas, arias, canzonets, and violin sonatas. Marcello often composed under the pseudonym Eterio Stinfalico, his name as a member of the celebrated Arcadian Academy (Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi). He died in Padua in 1747. Alessandro's brother was Benedetto Marcello (1686~1739), also a composer.

Although his works are infrequently performed today, Marcello is regarded as a very competent composer. His La Cetra concertos are ""unusual for their wind solo parts, concision and use of counterpoint within a broadly Vivaldian style,"" according to Grove, ""placing them as a last outpost of the classic Venetian Baroque concerto.""

A concerto Marcello wrote in d minor for oboe, strings and basso continuo is perhaps his best-known work. Its worth was attested to by Johann Sebastian Bach who transcribed it for harpsichord (BWV 974). A number of editions have been published of the famous Oboe Concerto in d minor. The edition in c minor is credited to Benedetto Marcello.",200,606,0,0,8947,2010-12-30 17:01:48,0,"유선빈, Alessandro, Marcello, A.Marcello, Concerto, per, Oboe, Archi e, Basso, Continuo, in, re, minore, SF.935, for, oboe, strings, and, basso, continuo, In, D-minor, SF935, Op.1, Opus1, Opus-1, Italian-Baroque, Music, Baroque Oboe, Baroque-Oboe, Hautbois, Barockoboe, Barock, Hoboe, Marcel, Ponseele, Ensemble, Il, Gardellino, Historically, informed, performance, On, period, instruments","A.

A: Sheet music for this can be found here:

Q: Who wrote Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor?
Q: Isn't that like asking who's buried in Grant's Tomb?
A: Heh-heh.  A theory has recently (1981) been put forth that J. S. Bach did not write this piece.  A brief summary of the supporting evidence for this theory can be read here:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor#Attribution

Q: Where can I get the mp3 of this?
A: You can download it here:

Q: What does the piece look like as a whole?
A: There are versions you can print out here
 http://www.musanim.com/printouts
The 'scroll' version is for cutting out and taping together to form a long strip.

Q: Where can I get the MIDI file that this was made from?
A: I'm not sure it's exactly the same, but the closest I could find was this:

Q: How did you make this video?
A: You can read about it here:
 http://www.musanim.com/ProductionNotes/ToccataAndFugueInDMinor.html

Q: What is the BWV number for this?
A: BWV 565

Q: Where does the toccata end and the fugue begin?
A: The fugue starts at 2:51 and the toccata returns at 7:12, but between these two points, parts which are strictly fugal alternate with episodes that are more toccata-like, so it's not 100% clear-cut (like in some other toccata/fugue pairs he wrote).

Q: What do the colors mean?
A: Each ""stop"" on the organ was played on a separate MIDI channel, and each MIDI channel was assigned a color.

Q: What is a fugue?
A: Here is a good introduction:

Q: Why does this piece of music remind me of horror movies?
A: Because it was used in the 1962 version of The Phantom of the Opera.  Before that, it did not have that connotation.  When Walt Disney and Leopold Stokowski used it in the 1940 film Fantasia, they considered it to be a purely abstract piece --- ""absolute music"" --- which brought to mind expressionistic forms and lines.",2787,518,0,1,110724,2005-12-10 20:14:30,0,"music, animation, visualization, classical, bach, organ, toccata, fugue, sheet, score, baroque","Bach, Toccata and Fugue in D minor, organ",ipzR9bhei_o,28963734,CKwCEAA,d,0,5,12,10,344,5,7.4618545503103,4.1956506224041865,5.044241766658823,3.445136968713304,7,49,0.1500776397515528,407,0.0,10,-0.05,7,0,5,0,3,1,1,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,41,0.6760037645666865,0.5622798721304089,1.464162909186962,1,0,7.0

Schubert wrote more popular works for piano, four hands and longer works for piano, four hands, but he never wrote a better work for piano, four hands than the Fantaisie in F minor, D. 940. Composed in January 1828, the work was premiered by Schubert and his friend, composer Franz Lachner, on 9 May of the same year at one the year's few Schubertiades. The work is in four continuous sections unified by the opening theme's melancholy tone of endless tragedy.

- It opens in the tonic with the sad, simple, and soulful tune Allegro molto moderato.
- This is followed by a stormy Largo in F sharp minor of tremendous pathos and power,
- then an Allegro vivace Scherzo also in F sharp minor.
- The tonic returns for the final section, a massive double fugue with a new subject set against the opening tune as a second subject. After an enormous polyphonic climax and a brief pause, the sad, simple, and soulful tune returns one last time, battered and beaten, but still singing its elegiac song.

The work was dedicated to Karoline Esterházy von Galánta, the daughter of his one time patron, the Duke of Esterházy, and bears an opus number assigned by the composer himself. Schubert was (unrequited) in love with Karoline, he composed the fantasia in such a way, that their hands would touch from time to time...",84,1167,0,0,4200,2015-12-03 23:53:52,0,,"Franz Schubert - Fantasia for piano, 4 hands in F minor, D. 940",uzjYQuDPi9Q,477518,CN4CEAA,d,0,15,12,3,337,3,5.678989746921516,2.206825876031849,3.6232492903979,1.9242792860618816,5,49,0.015378787878787875,283,0.0,0,-0.05,12,0,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,4,0,0,0,1,6,3,1,0,4,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,63,0.6380094791264594,0.3885947984371925,1.8829123800490688,0,0,7.0

Solução
(Luan Otten/Saulo Poncio) 

As vezes quero saber como anda você
Se vai bem sem mim e tentar entender
Que querer não é poder e se eu pudesse, iria me contradizer
Eu já tentei colocar os meus pés no chão
Me esforcei para achar uma solução
Só que essa solução pode ser bem melhor
Pra mim do que pra você

Eu quero te falar, o que se passa aqui
Eu quero retornar e se você deixar eu juro que

Dessa vez eu vou pensar só em nós
E o que eu errei prometo nunca mais errar
E se você perdoar nosso amor
Os nossos sonhos podem se realizar

Só te peço uma chance de voltar atrás
Para consertar o que errei
Para te mostrar que hoje sei
Só você sabe amar
E sobre nós o que eu desejo só você pode me dar
E deixa aqui entre nós o que passou já não importa
E hoje estamos a sós

Música : Nossa Conversa - Kell Smith
Letra : Só hoje eu desisti de nós mil vezes
E te odiei com mil razões diferentes
E aí você sorriu e já era

Me convenci que era impossível
E que amar demais representava perigo
E aí você me olhou e já era
Já era de se esperar não é?

Quem já sofreu por amor desconfia da flor
Mas olha que loucura né?
Te vi e os meus olhos mudaram de cor

Antes da gente dar nome já era pra sempre
E eu com medo de ser
Mas quando eu falo de amor por aí
É pensando em você

Antes da gente dar nome já era pra sempre
E eu com medo de ser
Mas quando eu falo de amor por aí
É pensando em você

O seu cheiro já seria o bastante
Pra me fazer pensar no que eu disse antes
Eu finjo não querer
Mas já era

A vida sempre coloca a gente em perigo
E você com certeza é o meu preferido
É só um toque seu e já era
Já era de se esperar não é?

Quem se faz de forte costuma ter medo da dor
Mas olha que loucura né?
Te vi e os meus olhos mudaram de cor
Antes da gente dar nome já era pra sempre

E eu com medo de ser
Mas quando eu falo de amor por aí
É pensando em você, só você

Te deixei a vontade demais
Ficou aberta nossa relação e quando eu vi
Escorregou entre os meus dedos
Tava provando de outros beijos

E pra minha surpresa, você pulo de tirolesa

E agora vem falar que foi fraqueza

Meu coração não é casa da mãe Joana
Pra você bagunçar igual ""cê"" faz na minha cama
Respeita quem te ama, ""cê"" acha que me ilude
Ou vaza ou me assume

(Silva / Lucas Silva)
      
Se você voltar pra ela 
Tente não se arrepender 
Vai ser difícil amar alguém 
Sem se querer
      
Melhor fazer valer a pena
E é bem melhor se conhecer 
Nas coisas do amor convém pagar pra ver
      
E fica tudo bem
Fica fica fica tudo bem 
Fica tudo bem
Fica fica fica tudo bem
      
Eu posso não saber de tudo 
Melhor as vezes nem saber 
Mas uma coisa eu sei ninguém 
Vai te dizer
      
Amigo, amar alguém a fundo 
É coisa séria de querer
Cuide de quem te quer e cuide de você
      
Que fica tudo bem 
Fica fica fica tudo bem

Mas é bem pior não ter você por perto

Eu não teria me apaixonado
Mas aconteceu 
Foi mais forte que eu e você

Aí eu disse:
Quer que eu faça um café?
Ou faça minha vida, se encaixar na sua?

0,Valestap,558,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"""Il bandito e il campione"" - Francesco De Gregori

Il testo del brano trae spunto da una storia vera,
l'amicizia giovanile fra il grande campione,
Costante Girardengo, e il pericoloso bandito,
Sante Pollastri, entrambi originari di Novi Ligure.
Un legame nato ai tempi delle strade sterrate
intrise di sudore e fatica, passioni e sentimenti.
Luci e ombre sull'asfalto, un ricordo struggente 
del ciclismo che fu e un'amara riflessione su
ciò che non sarebbe mai dovuto diventare.
Di Girardengo sappiamo tutto, vita morte e miracoli,
era talmente bravo che proprio per lui venne coniato
per la prima volta l'appellativo di campionissimo,
meritatamente ereditato in seguito da Fausto Coppi.
Di Sante Pollastri al contrario conosciamo ben poco;
soprannominato il ""bandito anarchico"" trascorse 
gran parte dell'esistenza combattendo un'impari lotta 
contro le forze dell'ordine fino all'inevitabile sconfitta.
Le scarne notizie di cronaca nera dell'epoca venivano 
infatti puntualmente censurate dal regime fascista 
per cui la loro veridicità risulta quanto meno dubbia.
Sempre avvolto nel mistero è rimasto ad esempio
il motivo per cui ce l'avesse tanto con i Carabinieri,
ne uccise una quindicina in diversi conflitti a fuoco,
forse per vendicarsi dell'uccisione di un cognato
o della morte del fratello, prelevato a forza da casa
per presentarsi alla chiamata di leva, nonostante fosse
gravemente malato, e poi morto in caserma.
La leggenda popolare racconta invece di uno stupro
perpretato ai danni della sorella Carmelina da parte
di un militare dell'arma, onta subito lavata col sangue 
dal Pollastri medesimo che a causa di questo delitto 
sarebbe quindi stato costretto a darsi alla latitanza.
Però nessuna di tali supposizioni trova riscontro 
oggettivo nella documentazione storica del periodo 
e anche riguardo la sua fede politica si nutrono dubbi;
egli stesso rispose al giudice che gli poneva specifica
domanda con un vago e lapidario: - Ho le mie idee -
L'anacronistica carriera dell'estemporaneo brigante 
ebbe termine a Parigi proprio nelle circostanze narrate
dall'autore nel testo: quel giorno si doveva disputare 
un criterium ciclistico con la partecipazione dell'amico 
campione e lui non seppe resistere alla tentazione di 
assistervi come spettatore, ma alla polizia era giunta
una soffiata e lo attese al varco per catturarlo. 
Sull'identità della presunta spia si sono fatte parecchie 
congetture, ma l'ipotesi più accreditata rimane quella  
che la colpevole del tradimento sia stata la sua donna.
Condannato all'ergastolo scontò gran parte della pena
nel carcere di massima sicurezza di Porto Santo Stefano 
fino alla concessione della grazia avvenuta nel 1959.
Una volta libero passerà il resto dei suoi giorni facendo
il venditore ambulante per guadagnarsi da vivere. 
Sante Pollastri morì solo e dimenticato  il 30 Aprile 1979
questa l'unica cosa certa, tutto il resto è leggenda.",1033,259,0,0,14170,2010-05-22 08:24:16,0,"BanditoCampione, FrancescoDeGregori, AnnaPaolaFrancia, CostanteGirardengo, SantePollastri, Ciclismo, NoviLigure, RaiFiction, VideoClip, ArchiviDellaMemoria",Il Bandito e il Campione - Francesco De Gregori,oXOZBjcECPo,7303421,CPoBEAA,e,0,10,5,22,142,5,6.8635263359292775,2.7466341989375787,4.151369850247462,3.0141003215196207,6,20,0.0,404,0.0,9,0.0,8,0,3,0,2,1,5,0,1,0,4,0,0,2,1,3,4,1,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,47,0.6048450384047943,0.4001782851126341,1.3773164153190702,1,0,7.0

AMOR À PRIMEIRA ESQUINA [ Letra ]
Compositores: Natanael Silva, Juan Marcos, Hiago Vinicius, Junior Pepato, Elcio di Carvalho

Quando eu sai de casa
Bem que o coração me avisou
Leva um guarda chuva
Que hoje pode ser
Que chova amor
Que chova amor

Mas eu não dei ouvido
Sai desprevenido
Achei que nunca ia acontecer comigo
E aconteceu
O destino deu um empurrãozinho
Colocando o seu caminho
No mesmo que o meu
No mesmo que o meu

Foi amor a primeira esquina ai ai
Procurei um defeito ela não tinha ai ai
Bem que o meu coração me avisou
Abriu o sorriso e o tempo fechou

Foi amor a primeira esquina ai ai
Procurei um defeito ela não tinha ai ai
Bem que o meu coração me avisou
Abriu o sorriso e o tempo fechou

Mistura Louca - [ Letra ]

Tô morando só agora é só alegria
Farra lá em casa rola quase todo dia

Mulherada de biquini na piscina
Tomando wiskie e red bull pra entrar no clima

Não tô nem aí eu não quero nem saber
A vida é minha e é assim que eu quero viver

Rodeado de mulher quase o tempo todo
Estilo paniquete é claro eu não sou bobo

Liga pra Juju chama a Dani pra vir
Traz a Bruna a Marcele e também a Gabi

Hoje vai rolar o movimento de novo
Chega pra cá os Havaianos vai convida o povo

Os Havaianos estão chegando e o bicho vai pegar
Deixa comigo que agora eu vou selecionar

Você pode ir, você pode também, 
Essa dali não pode nem idade ela tem

Solteiras podem ir, casadas vem também,
O marido não pode porque homem aqui já tem

Ai que mistura louca,
Já deu água na boca

Motherfuckers said it wasnt gonna work (word)
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo eazy! (yo!)
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit

[eazy-e]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the alpine play
Bumpin new shit by nwa
It was gangsta gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin like this:

Cruisin down the street in my six-fo
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh el camino rolled, kilo g
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that gta

*chorus*

Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy, cuz I aint sayin shit

[eazy-e]
Down on bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man jb is on freebase
The boy jb was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, la times first page

*chorus*

[eazy-e]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit, wouldnt you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his whole ass out

*chorus*

[eazy-e]
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the six-fo round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I see the g ride
Now ket is drivin kilo on the side
As they busted a u, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green nova
Ket got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his guess
Now g is cut for doin the crime
For defence on the boy, hell do some time

*chorus*

[eazy-e]
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municiple court
Kilo g on trial straight cold cut a fork
Distruption of a court, said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didnt budge
Bailer came over to turn him in
Kilo g looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire!, then came suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi

Puya:

E super sa faci bani, sa detii sume mari
Toti vor sa stie de unde ai gologani
Majoritatea au boala, vor sa te traga pe sfoara
Ramai uimit cati prieteni o dau in bara
Ca daca ai toti cred ca tre s-arunci cu ei
Totul costa, bai nene la banii tai
Toti vor un imprumut, telefonul suna mult
Si cand ii ceri inapoi iti zic: Bai faci urat?
Dar habar n-au prin ce-ai trecut, ca tre sa suferi mult
Sunt clipe grele pe care n-o sa le uit
Ti-am zis mama, ca ai baiat inteligent
Sa fac prima melodie, am strans fiecare cent
Acum nu mai bem bere la cutie, bem Moet
Nu mai creem probleme, creem un trend
Multi stiu unde-am ajuns , dar nu stiu de unde vin
Drumu-i lung, greu pan la american dream

Refren:

In ploaie ne-am facut adapostul
Dar nu o stie nimeni, o stie doar Tatal nostru
Drumul pan’aici a fost monstru
Dar nu o stie nimeni, o stie doar Tatal nostru
Cu ani de zile noi ne-am platit costu’
Dar nu o stie nimeni, o stie doar Tatal nostru

Dar nu o stie nimeni, o stie doar Tatal nostru

F.Charm:

Am panze de paianjen in ochi si nu se rup
Am zile negre la activ cu care inca lupt
Ca multi ma vad abia acum si-mi zic c-am ajuns sus
Si au impresia ca toata viata mi-am trait-o-n puf
Dar numai eu stiu cat am tras si martor imi e ceru’
Cu zile negre ma hraneam, era gol frigideru’
Si cand venea ispita simteam in oase geru’
Ca m-am luptat cu mine sa-mi tin curat cazieru’
Haitele de lupi imi sapau gropile in taine
Sa cad in ele sa ma duc , sa ma scape de haine
Stelele paleau si ma lasau in urma
Dar oaia neagra a iesit singura din turma
Si cred c-avenit timpul, ca bate la usa tare
C-o sticla de vin divin si doua pahare
O sa-mi fac noptile albe, las ficatu’sa indure
S-a odhinit cam mult ca zile negre-au fost destule

Sisu Tudor:

Si-a venit de la sine, n-a fost usor, dar ce bine ca-i bine
Am vazut tot felul de zile, feline agile, dar nu mi-e frica de nimeni
Desi ma tem  de multe si mi-e teama de mine
Ca-mi sunt dusman inrait si cand da sa fie senin, norii tot eu ii agit
Ratacesc zici ca-i Moise-n Egipt
Fi atent, n-are cum sa nu fie asa cum cred
Viitorul era incert pana am iesit din cerc
Nu-s facut s-alerg un cec, daca-i vorba de bani cu mine fa-i sa curga abundent
Am nevoie de de-o strategie, putina duhovnicie, disciplina prin ucenicie
Curaj sa dam marturie, e-un drum lung si trebuie abordat cu tarie
Uneori si-afara zici ca-i tot puscarie
Doar ca-i altfel de colivie
Si baietii pe strada-i spun Romanie!

GOD I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH

If you followed me on Twitter mid-August, I'd tweet a picture of Pirate Len literally everyday. He's my bae. MY BAE.
Aheeem.

As halloween's right around the corner, this is the perfect song to jam out to in your pirate garb. Which you should totally do after fighting the skeleton war, of course. I hope my lyrics were able to convey the excitement I got from the song haha

On such a silent night, opening the window
Wishing the ticking of the clock would put you right to sleep
On such night you'll be visited by a pixie
Taken to Neverland, where dreams never end

No way hosé, I hate how grown ups rule the world 
Dripping with lies, reality's disgusting!
Man, I wish that I could be a kid forever
... Then what about we make that wish come true together?
(EH!?)

To a place where the fun never ends~! 
(Lazy vacation that'll never end) 
Treasure hunting, always playing, sword fighting, misbehaving, perfect world!
(Really!?)
My studies? Forget it!
My future? Forget about it!
Come along with me and you'll see what I mean - a dream world!

Take a leap of faith! I jump and run away as if it were a dream
Selfishly naiive, childish me believes it's alright, so could you just forgive me?
Stuffing all of it into my pocket, the reality I hated so
It's so wonderful, it's so magical 
Off to Neverland we go! 
Let's go!

Singing songs with pretty mermaids in lagoons
Running through fields and camping with the Indians
Peter Pan, are there any problems?
Nope, everything's about me in this world here, it's so awesome!!

Boy, oh boy, we got a problem! Captain Hook is coming here to make you pay-- kya!
I'll get you, Peter Pan, today's the day!! Yo- ho- yo-!
Defeat him! That monster! Please help us, become our hero!
Don't you think that it's time to make your dream come true, no?

Take a leap of faith! Defeat him in this happy little fantasy
Punish all of the grown ups that you see, all of them so cunning and so greedy
Fighting scene so intense, ends with a splash, and everybody comes to cheer
Hero now renowned, he's elated, now drunk on the atmosphere, yeah!

After he took down the evil in the land
The peaceful days pass by over and over again
You know, something feels a little off
I don't know, is something not enough?
Don't you feel the same? Things are L-A-M-E LAME!!

Dream come true, little Peter Pan isn't really little anymore
Treasure hunting and wooden sword fighting, nothing is as fun as it was before
Entering the old captain's cabin in the pirate ship he's taking hold
That's right baby, I'm a pirate matey, hard a starboard we go!! 
(YEAH!!)

Take a leap of faith! Destroy the land cause you can never run away
Greedy as I am, try to understand, I'm a grown up now, so please forgive me
Putting all of it into my pocket, happy fantasy I hold so fond 
It's so wonderful, it's so magical

〜Portrait of the Pirate F〜

On a quiet night
With the windows open
On a sleepless night
The clock keeps ticking
On a night like this
A little fairy shows up
and will take you to the place where dreams never end, to the Neverland…

No, no, NO WAY!!
Adults make up stories about the world
It's all bullshit, a dirty reality!
I want to stay a child forever......
......Here I come to make your dream come true♡
「Whoa!」

The place where the fun never ends
Slow and easy, it keeps going
Adventures, fun activities, and sword fights
You can play all day and you don't have to behave! (For real?  
Studies? Don't have to!
About the future? No need to think!
To the world where only children’s dreams exist!

Let’s get high entirely
It’s my dream getaway anyway
Forgive me for being selfish and sassy! 
Because I’m just being childish!

All those realities I hated
Put them back in my pocket 
Such a fun place
Such a wonderful place
Let’s go to the land of children!

Singing with a beautiful mermaid
Running through a field and camping with an Indian 
How are you doing, Peter Pan?
Good! I rule the world and it’s awesome!

Oh boy! Mr. Hook is here to get us!
Help!
I’m gonna take you down! Peter Pan! Yo, Ho, Yo! 
Please take that cold-blooded villain down, our hero! 
This is the time to make your dream come true!

Let’s kick their ass recklessly 
What an amusing fantasy
Punish those cunning greedy bad adults!

Dueling sequence gets so excited 
Denouement with a standing ovation 
Getting a big head
Acting like a hero
I’m getting high, phew!

Took down the evil of the Neverland
A peaceful day passes by
Over and over
「You know......something is wrong......」
「You know......something is missing......」 
「You know what......everything is BORING!!」

Peter Pan, the boy who made his dream come true became a little bit matured 
A journey of adventures
Sword fights
He just realized that he is tired of it and he’s done with it

Finally he took over the captain’s cabin of this pirate ship 
Yes, I’m gonna play pirate from today
Hard a starboard! (Yeah!!

Let’s make a mess boldly
It’s my getaway and I can’t go back anyway 
Forgive me for being cunning and greedy 
Because I’m just being an adult!

The world I loved
Put it back in my pocket
Such a fun dream
Such a wonderful dream 
Keep this endless dream alive

The Big Bad Blues, as the title suggests, focuses on Gibbons’ lifelong love of the blues and rock & roll, showcasing the blues-influenced vocals and guitar licks that have together served as the foundation for his numerous hits over the past five decades. The album features 11 tracks balancing some classic covers like “Rollin’ and Tumblin’” and “Standing Around Crying,” along with some of Billy’s signature new blues originals.

“We successfully made our way through those uncharted waters with the Cubano flavor of Perfectamundo and completed the journey,” says Gibbons in distinguishing The Big Bad Blues from its predecessor. “The shift back to the blues is a natural. It’s something which our followers can enjoy with the satisfaction of experiencing the roots tradition and, at the same time, feeling the richness of stretching the art form.”",48,181,0,0,2715,2018-07-20 12:55:29,0,"billy gibbons, zz top, concord, rock, blues, guitar, zz, lyric video, rollin and tumblin, bfg, Billy F Gibbons, Billie Gibbons",Billy F Gibbons - Rollin' and Tumblin' (Lyric Video),rqkXNBvVIhg,213570,CMgBEAA,f,0,18,7,20,201,4,5.329540247656665,2.250420002308894,3.4337698339248663,1.6812412373755872,5,29,0.006439393939393953,145,0.375,11,0.25,8,0,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,6,0,0,5,1,4,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,52,0.6442900652518112,0.4222540590247681,2.0424016242219767,0,1,7.0

Concerto No. 4 in F minor, Op. 8, RV 297, ""L'inverno"" (Winter)
  -   Allegro non molto
  -   Largo
   -  Allegro

The Four Seasons (Italian: Le quattro stagioni) is a set of four violin concertos by Antonio Vivaldi. Composed in 1725, The Four Seasons is Vivaldi's best-known work, and is among the most popular pieces in the classical music repertoire. The texture of each concerto is varied, each resembling its respective season. For example, ""Winter"" is peppered with silvery pizzicato notes from the high strings, calling to mind icy rain, whereas ""Summer"" evokes a thunderstorm in its final movement, which is why the movement is often called ""Storm"" (as noted in the list of derivative works).

The concertos were first published in 1725 as part of a set of twelve concerti, Vivaldi's Op. 8, entitled Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione (The Contest Between Harmony and Invention). Vivaldi dedicated their publication to a Bohemian patron, Count Václav Morzin (of Vrchlabí 1676--1737), and in so mentioned the count's longstanding regard for these four, in particular (which had apparently been performed with the nobleman's orchestra, in Prague's Morzin Palace)—although his dedication may have been closely related to the completion of an Augustinian monastery that year, where Vivaldi, a priest himself, refers to Morzin, the church's dedicator, as ""Chamberlain and Counsellor to His Majesty, the Catholic Emperor""—while (as Maestro di Musica in Italy) Vivaldi presents them anew, with sonnets or enhancements for clear interpretation. The first four concertos are designated Le quattro stagioni, each being named after a season. Each one is in three movements, with a slow movement between two faster ones (and these movements likewise vary in tempo amid the seasons as a whole). At the time of writing The Four Seasons, the modern solo form of the concerto had not yet been defined (typically a solo instrument and accompanying orchestra). Vivaldi's original arrangement for solo violin with string quartet and basso continuo helped to define the form of the concerto.

Sonnets and allusions

There is some debate as to whether the four concertos were written to accompany four sonnets or vice versa. Though it is not known who wrote these sonnets, there is a theory that Vivaldi wrote them himself, given that each sonnet is broken down into three sections, neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Whoever wrote the sonnets, The Four Seasons may be classified as program music, instrumental music that intends to evoke something extra-musical and an art form which Vivaldi was determined to prove sophisticated enough to be taken seriously.

In addition to these sonnets, Vivaldi provided instructions such as ""The barking dog"" (in the second movement of ""Spring""), ""Languor caused by the heat"" (in the first movement of ""Summer""), and ""the drunkards have fallen asleep"" (in the second movement of ""Autumn""). The Four Seasons is used in the 1981 film The Four Seasons along with other Vivaldi concertos for flute.

0,Ashish Xiangyi Kumar,58,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"An exciting and subtle performance from Glemser. For Schumann, the sonata was more of an exploratory narrative rather than an architecture -- his form is always organic, idiosyncratic. The third sonata is particularly hard to interpret as a coherent whole, as it is bursting at the seams with incredible ideas stacked one on top of the other in rapid succession: in the 1st + 4th movements lyrical melodies are pulled taut across madcap scales and arpeggios; the rhythms are obsessively dotted, in typical fashion; there's lots of hair-raising gear-shifting and scampering pianissimo passages that turn to mush if you seeks safety in the sustaining pedal. Glemser's performance is a triumph precisely because it manages to bring unity and clarity to such a bedazzlingly inventive work. It is a testament to the musical value of this seldom-played work that it was premiered five years after the composer’s death by Brahms, who loved it very much.

00:00 -- Mvt 1, Allegro brillante: Schumann places emphasis on the intermezzo-like transitions from one theme to another, elevating them to thematic status in Beethovenesque style. The development section, which begins with a false reprise [3:30] as memorable as it is deceptive, stresses some of the apparently trivial motivic material of the exposition.
07:52 -- Mvt 2, Scherzo -- Notice that opening of the Scherzo anticipates the ""Clara"" theme of the third movement. The movement features some fascinating contrapuntal textures [see the passage beginning at 12:08].
14:00 -- Mvt 3, Quasi Variazioni. A deeply moving set of variations built around the same Clara theme (the notes spell out CLARA in German) that Brahms used in his Schumann Variations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVLGC...), and which is *already present* in the first movement's dramatic LH opening statement. The theme as used here is strange in form -- a series of four-measure units arranged AABBCC, lacking the expected restatement at the end. In the four variations the theme is never found in its original twenty-four-bar form. Sometimes it is shortened: in Variation 1, the form becomes AABAA; in Variation 3, which is cast in binary form, the A theme is followed only by B. At other times, the theme is expanded: in Variation 2, the “expected” reprise (AA) is added at the end; in Variation 4, a two-measure version of A is followed by a six-measure version of B, after which a substantial coda is appended.
 22:20 -- Mvt 4, Prestissimo possibile. This movement features wildly inventive textures [25:17], spikily humoresque-ish figuration,  and the relentless superimposition of puzzling rhythms over the basic meter in an effort to destroy the listener’s sense of the bar line. The opening figuration is yet another veiled reference to the Clara theme, and the finale features some gloriously colourful writing.",30,1762,0,0,1343,2016-03-11 17:04:49,0,"Schumann, Piano Sonata 3, F minor, Bernd Glemser, Romantic, Classical, Virtuoso, Piano, Keyboard, Score, Sheet Music, Scrolling, Sonata, Op.14, Fantasy, Concerto without Orchestra","Schumann: Sonata No.3 in F minor, Op.14 (Glemser)",EClZICLRxrE,215176,CKwCEAA,f,0,16,3,11,71,4,5.332793829964515,1.7634279935629371,3.1280760126687155,1.4771212547196624,5,10,0.12657894736842104,450,-0.016666666666666666,15,-0.05,7,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,3,5,3,1,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,49,0.5865735883304399,0.3306761989661752,2.1176839766362865,0,1,7.0

He is said to have been meticulous in his writing, and, finally, a group of musicians have matched his efforts in terms of attention. This is, in my opinion, the best performance and recording of this piece.

The second movement is possibly the most known, as audiences remember the pizzicato opening; its usage in media, such as for the film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (W. Anderson) and as trailer music for films such as ""Be Kind Rewind"" (M. Gondry) also furthers its memorability. Assez vif introduces two new melodies; a rhythmic melody and a contrasting ""sung"" melody, which is both graceful and heroic. It is as though these are character motifs.

Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta f**k Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta f**k Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta f**k Wit
There's noplace to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
BAM! Aw, MAN! I SLAM
JAM, now scream like Tarzan

I be tossin, enforcin, my style is awesome
I'm causin more Family Feud's than Richard Dawson
And the survey said -- ya dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your f**kin head
MZA who was that? Aiyyo, the Wu is back
Makin n***az go BO BO!, like on Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum!

I puts the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to f**k it up
My style carries like a pickup truck
Across the clear blue yonder
Seek the China Sea, I slam tracks like quarterbacks sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test, the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake

Some of these are not High Fs. There are a number of High Es:

-Ingeborg Hallstein
-Pretty Yende
-Sylvia Geszty
-and the second Maria Aleida video
are all High Es.

Also there is of course a High A at the end done by Maria Remola.

As well as a weird interpolated High G/Ab by Erna Sack

The point is that this a collection of sopranos who chose to do the added High ending. 

There are some changes compared to the old coloraturafan post:

The Rodica Vica video quality was terrible so I substituted her with Pretty Yende (who did the aria in the original E major but is still awesome). I substituted the original Edita Gruberova live recording with a studio recording that I consider higher in class. I moved the Mado Robin one to the end, and changed it to a better quality version, but lol I don't know why. And I also substituted the Sari Barabas one with Erna Sack cuz the Barabas one came out buzzy and terrible quality. I also substituted the Mady Mesple one with a video version.

Allegro moderato introduces the main theme to be repeated in movements III and IV. The atmosphere developed is one of warmth and a contrasting vastness. The last 30 seconds always gave me the impression of falling asleep, once again surrounded by warmth.

An orchestral work by Croatian composer Dora Pejačević (1885-1923). The daughter of the Croatian ban (governor) Theodor Pejačević, Dora Pejačević began her musical career as a soloist on the piano and violin, often performing her own compositions at drawing-room events. Eventually, interest in her music grew and her oeuvre expanded to 57 catalogued works by 1923, including one Symphony. Pejačević composed the work between 1916 and 1917, and along with Frank Lučić's 1917 symphony, it is the first musical work in the form by a Croatian. Her success as a composer culminated in the 1918 premiere of two movements of her symphony by the Tonkünstler-Orchester Niederösterreich under the baton of Oskar Nedbal. Soon after, Pejačević made some changes to the work and the premiere of the full symphony in its revised edition was given in Dresden two years later.

[Intro]
Mello made it right

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Aston Martin, push-button motor (yeah)
Migos on the ice (yeah), anti-sober
Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt
Turn around and throw it in reverse (whoop)
Let me see how you work
You boys smokin' dirt (on Gelato), we smokin' Larry Bird
Saint Laurent straitjacket, go berserk
Turn around and throw it in reverse

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
DB11, it's a 'vert (skrrt skrrt), it goes skrrt
Keep her panty droppin', ridin' shotgun like she Kurt
Weavin' through the traffic with my ratchet in the purse
In a Saint Laurent straitjacket, if I crash, I go berserk
Overseas I need a visa, breezin' in Ibiza
Tryna' see me when I'm speedin'
You get burnt like Derek Jeter
And my Nina, she's a diva, purty like Lupita
Peter Piper, pick a pussy, make her peck my millimeter
Chilly on the chain but the seats is heated
Shawty wanna race like I been believin'
Spent three G's on the sneakers
Like three stripes and a slash, I'm undefeated
Rick Owens, I'm tip-toein', push button, Kim Jong
Rode through lookin' so cool in a old school like Vince Vaughn
Vroom vroom, nitro, hit the turbo
Pour that Ace of Spades up, we don't want no Merlot
Cop the coupe, drop the roof, hop out the top like I'm a turtle (ooh)
Then she turn around and throw it in reverse though

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Aston Martin, push-button motor (yeah)
Migos on the ice (yeah), anti-sober
Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt (watch out)
Turn around and throw it in reverse (whoop)
Let me see how you work
You boys smokin' dirt, we smokin' Larry Bird
Saint Laurent straitjacket, go berserk
Don't get hurt, turn around and throw it in reverse

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, bend that ass over, throw it backwards
Moonwalk into the pussy like I'm Michael Jackson (oh)
Make a film with your bitch, turn into an actor (ah)
Shimmy out and then she ate a pill after
I get clothes from Vaccarello, I get Céline from Slimane
I get packages from Paris, drop that Fed-Ex, sign my name
I get runway, off the runway, to the runway on the plane
Told you we are not the same, see that Spider switchin' lanes?
Give it some gas, look at the dash
What is he doin'? He goin' fast
Look at the whip, look at him smash
Look at him skrrt, look at the cash
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a man that's gone insane
He's onstage in a straitjacket, this is not a game
Yeah, lit like a candle, I been too much to handle
This velvet jacket's fragile, 'Kay, be careful when you handle, please
(Why did you touch me?) Yeah, your hands look kind of dusty
Please be careful how you touch me, in Paris, out the country, ayy

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]

Lyrics:

Watch me take it up, then I break it down
I don't play sports, but it'sa touchdown
Ha-I don't blend in, I-ha-I'm a black sheep
And even then, ha, they still follow me
I rock three stripes, can go and check my closet
Ne-Never share the gwap, can go and take my wallet
I'm a comet heading this planet
Sitting on the throne and these haters can't stand it

DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feelin' low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again ye-eah
DJ, spin it back if you're feelin' me
The 8 'o' 8 track is all I need

Were it not for friendly rivalry, our culture would be much the poorer. Artists do not even need to be in daily contact, as Wordsworth and Coleridge were. They can influence and help each other simply through the quality of their work. So it was with Mozart and the Haydns. With the younger brother, Michael, Wolfgang Amadeus was always friendly; but he did not meet the greater of the two, Joseph, until at least 1783 – when his interaction with this master of the symphony and the string quartet was quite advanced – and a burgeoning relationship was cut short by Haydn’s travels and Mozart’s death.",7,2005,0,1,267,2018-01-19 17:00:04,0,"Veronika Hagen, viola, PLAY_FP, concert, Mozart, cello, Clemens Hagen, Rainer Schmidt, Lukas Hagen, Haydn, Hagen Quartett, music, Salzburg, String Quartet, violin, Mozarteum",Mozart - String Quartet No.14 in G major K.387 “Spring” (Hagen Quartet),L9HlwFVU7D0,20908,CPoBEAA,g,0,18,1,19,19,4,4.320312491425713,1.2041199826559248,2.4265112613645754,0.8450980400142568,4,3,0.15916666666666665,163,0.0,15,0.0625,11,0,5,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,3,1,0,0,1,4,3,1,0,6,0,6,2,0,0,0,0,1,71,0.5616517939802593,0.278711316610934,2.871277823959502,0,1,7.0

Mendelssohn piano concerto opus 25

Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1 in G minor (op. 25) was written in 1830--1, around the same time as his fourth symphony (""Italian""), and premiered in Munich in October 1831. He had already written a piano concerto in A minor with string accompaniment (1822) and two concertos with two pianos (1823--4). The three connected movements —

Molto allegro con fuoco in G minor
Andante in E major
Presto—Molto allegro e vivace in G major
use several relatively new formal techniques in their brief span — for example, the piano enters very soon after the opening of the first movement, with little of an orchestral tutti to contrast with.[1] The concerto quickly obtained popularity, and contains many sections of improvisation, one of Mendelssohn's specialities.

LYRICS
A La Une, Toute ma Génération importune,
Le Gouvernement se sent menacé 'Yeah'
Par la réalité sont rattrapés 'Yeah'
Quand j'l'allume, je la fume, je la hume et j'l'assume,
Je ne le cache pas à la société 'Non'
Et Refuse d'etre catalogué 'Yeah'

J'suis d'ceux qui la légalise déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
J'promotionne pas mais tu sais déja, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Ganjaman depuis longtemps déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Smokin' Weed ah it's a real pleasure, Jah, Jah

On parle de cannabis, on parle Sativa,
On parle de Weed, de Ganja, de Marijuana,
Elle figure sur la liste, des drogues à la police,
Donc si t'en fumes, sache qu'on va t 'arrêter pour ca,
Malgré ses vertus médicales, elle reste illégale,
Donc pour tes graines de Zamal, on t'emmene au tribunal
Quand meme pour un Végétal, Qui est 100% Natural
Je trouve ca bizarre que l'Etat le prenne si radical
Anti-douleur, anti-vomitif, anti-spasmodique,
Laisse moi t'citer des cas où l'herbe ferait bien d'être prescrite
La sclérose en plaque, le Sida et même la maladie d'Crohn
Crise d'asthme, le cancer et contre les glaucomes,
Elle est utile dans le textile ou pour en faire de l'huile
Dans la construction et dans l'agro-carburant
Isolation phonique, thermique et même dans les cosmétiques,
Dans la papeterie, je m'arrête ici ! 

Smoke Di Sensi

J'suis d'ceux qui la légalise déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
J'promotionne pas mais tu sais déja, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Ganjaman depuis longtemps déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Smokin' Weed ah it's a real pleasure, Jah, Jah

Un message à mes ptits frères,
Sachez qu'elle a du caractère, 
Pas du genre à s'laisser faire,
Peut avoir l'effet contraire,
Pour être plus clair :
Selon ton état d'esprit, peut être amie ou ennemie, 
Elle et Moi c'est pour la Vie,
En même temps, je pense que c'est le bon moment,
Qu'ils réalisent qu'on est plus d'un million,
A militer pour sa libération, alors en attendant :
On allume, on la fume, on la hume, on l'assume,
Exploitée depuis des centaines d'années 'Yeah'
Par les grands Etats et leurs armées 'Yeah'
Wowowoh, 
Quand j'l'allume, je la fume, je la hume et j'l'assume,
Je ne le cache pas à la société 'Non'
Et Refuse d'etre catalogué 'Yeah'
Wowowoh

J'suis d'ceux qui la légalise déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
J'promotionne pas mais tu sais déja, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Ganjaman depuis longtemps déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Smokin' Weed ah it's a real pleasure, Jah, Jah

J'suis d'ceux qui la légalise déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
J'promotionne pas mais tu sais déja, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Ganjaman depuis longtemps déjà, Jah, Chalalalalawa
Smokin' Weed ah it's a real pleasure, Jah, Jah

About: The Red Bull Air Race World Championship features the world's best pilots in a motorsports competition based on speed, precision and skill. Using the fastest, most agile and lightweight racing planes, Red Bull Air Race pilots navigate a low-level aerial race track made up of air filled pylons, flying at speeds reaching 230mph while withstanding forces of up to 10g. The objective is to complete the course, navigating the 65 feet high specially designed inflatable pylons known as Air Gates in the fastest possible time. Red Bull Air Race pilots must pass between the Air Gates in the correct position taking care not to touch them with their wings. The pilots compete for points at each Red Bull Air Race and the one who accumulates the most at the end of the season is crowned Red Bull Air Race World Champion.

Hook:

Em ơi, anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Đến khi chết tất cả đều giống nhau, 
Đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Nước mắt chưa rơi thì anh đã chóng lau,
Viên kẹo đắng nghe nói sẽ chống đau, 
Mà, anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Em ơi, anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 

Đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Đâu muốn thấy  mình sống lâu, 
Nước mắt chưa rơi thì anh đã chóng lau,
Em ơi, anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Viên kẹo đắng nghe nói sẽ chống đau, 
Em ơi, anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 

Verse 1:

Anh đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu, 
Trường giang sóng trước thua sóng sau, 
Đem linh hồn anh đang có, 
Đi đâu để mua được sang giàu, 
Anh vốn đã chết từ ban đầu, 
Nên khi thần chết có đến, không van cầu, 
Yêu anh thì yêu không trả giá,
Vì người như anh với em không đáng đâu, 
Đêm qua, anh uống thêm 1 chút, và anh hút thêm 1 chút, 
Đem hết tâm sự anh có trút vô ngòi bút, 
Em ơi anh sống và làm quá nhiều điều sai, 
Em ơi anh đâu có muốn sống vì ngày mai, 
Em ơi anh đâu có muốn sống nhờ thương hại, 
Anh là nhân vật chính nhưng chết ở chương hai, 
Quá nhiều người mong được trường sinh trong khi vẫn còn lầm lẫn giữa được sống và tồn tại, 
Yeah ah, họ nói người tốt thì chết sớm, 
Anh đang kề cận tuổi 27, 
Cái tuổi thần chết hay đến đón, 
Những kẻ vác tâm sự trên vai gầy, 
Đừng nói với anh chuyện mai này, 
Hãy để anh chết không ai biết, ai hay, 
Đừng để những người anh yêu thương đổi thay, và chính đôi mắt của anh đã phải thấy.

Verse 2:

em ơi a đâu muốn thấy mình sống lâu....
cát bụi về đất có phải đều giống nhau ...
ai cũng thèm muốn cho mình cuộc sống giàu..
nhưng cơn bão tới thì họ mới đóng tàu...
sao anh chịu dc nổi đau ?
sao lòng người thay đổi mau 
sau từng chuyện chỉ riêng anh tình nguyện... 
cho từng viên vào miệng để kết thúc cuộc đời...
a ko muốn thấy việc người thân mình đi trước 
nên em đừng buồn làn mi ướt....
đổi thanh xuân để yêu em ... sinh mạng a là giọt buồn tràn ly nước...
viên thứ nhất thật vô vị .... viên thứ hai mắt khô đi 
viên thứ ba là vô tri ...    viên thứ 4 vào OD
họ thích mới hơn thích cũ...biết thêm ko biết đủ... 
lương tâm vào biệt giam nuôi lòng tham trong giấc ngủ....  
 nó lớn lên từng ngày ... chưa trả thứ mình vay ...
họ phớt lờ sự thật như hằng ngày chưa từng thấy ...
họ tin thứ dc dạy ...  thần tượng thứ dc thấy... 
họ truyền tai với nhau muốn sống lâu đừng nói bậy...
nên e oi a dau muốn thay minh  ... sống lâu ...",670,262,0,1,28601,2018-08-16 15:07:20,0,"B Ray, Bray, Young H, youngh, DMSL, EvBrecords, echvabaorecords",Đâu Muốn Sống Lâu (#DMSL) - B Ray x Young H  (Prod.

J.Sheon與美味星棒棒糖跨界合作
集合頂級新生代創作人
打造年度最強品牌主題曲
重新詮釋『Taste for Fun』品牌精神
 
2017最受矚目新人J.Sheon，再度推出集魔性與甜膩於一身的全新數位單曲《壞蛋特調》，旋律將不自覺的入侵大腦並控制身體來跟著節奏蠕動，這次和老戰友們-新銳音樂製作人米奇林、剃刀蔣默契打造以Electric Funk曲風為底，融入Hip Hop與R&B元素的饒唱情歌。
 
MV將女孩隱喻為帶著誘人色彩、讓人垂涎欲滴的棒棒糖，三個女孩各自有三種獨特個性口味：性感時尚、甜美可愛、瘋狂不羈，哪一個才是你的極品女孩？三處意想不到的都市角落，市區廢墟叢林、老字號理髮廳、深夜菜市場，浪漫心動的情節卻正在偷偷上演。男人被散發炫麗光芒的女孩所吸引，在這一個奇幻繽紛的夜裡，音樂加溫兩人之間心跳加速的性感電力，一場魔幻寫實的城市追逐戰就此展開。

Lyrics:

Indochina, Capa jumps Jeep, two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record meat lumps and war,
They advance as does his chance -- very yellow white flash.
A violent wrench grips mass, rips light, tears limbs like rags,
Burst so high finally Capa lands,
Mine is a watery pit. Painless with immense distance
From medic from colleague, friend, enemy,
foe, him five yards from his leg, From you Taro.
Do not spray into eyes -- I have sprayed you into my eyes.
3:10 pm, Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey, shrivelled and stricken to dots,
Left hand grasps what the body grasps not -- le photographe est mort.
3.1415, alive no longer my amour, faded for home May of '54
Doors open like arms my love, Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing,
re-united with his leg and with you, Taro.
Do not spray into eyes -- I have sprayed you into my eyes.
Hey Taro!

“The Empty Chair”
Music & Lyrics by J. Ralph & Sting © 2016
Produced by J. Ralph
Co-Produced by Arthur Pingrey

LYRICS:
If I should close my eyes 
That my soul can see 
And there’s a place at the table 
That you saved for me
So many thousand miles 
O’er land and sea
I hope to dare
That you hear my prayer 
And somehow I’ll be there

There’s but a concrete floor 
Where my head will lay
And the walls of this prison 
Are as cold as clay
But there’s a shaft of light 
Where I count my days
So don’t despair
Of the empty chair 
And somehow I’ll be there

Some days I’m strong 
Some days I’m weak
And days when I’m broken
I can barely speak 
There’s a place in my head 
Where my thoughts still roam 
And somehow I’ve come home

And when the winter comes 
And the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window 
In the darkness there
Well I was always late
For every meal, you’ll swear

But keep my place 
And the empty chair 
And somehow I’ll be there 
And somehow I’ll be there",0,193,0,0,0,2016-12-23 18:38:35,0,"J. Ralph, Sting, JRalph, The Empty Chair, Jim, James Foley Story, Soundtrack, Sndtrk",“The Empty Chair” By J.

Lyrics

Scattered all around
lie the splinters of the past
night crashes to the ground
tears of rage won't hold me down
If only, If only I had known love would leave me wounded
we won the battle but lost the war

I'll stand up tall
and I will rise and fight like a warrior
High above it all
I'll rise and fight like a warrior


Last time I lost my mind
This time I will fight like a warrior
Last time I lost my pride
This time I will fight like a warrior
Oh - oh - oh, Oh - oh - oh
This time I will fight like a warrior
Oh - oh - oh, Oh - oh - oh
For love I will fight like a warrior


On this battleground
only love will still survive
You bring us back to life
when sparks of fury burn us down
cuz I know, yeah I know
I know we will make it out alive
We lost the battle but won the war

And we won't fall
our faith keeps fighting strong like a warrior
high above it all
I'll rise and fight like a warrior

Oh - oh - oh, Oh - oh - oh
This time I will fight like a warrior
Oh - oh - oh, Oh - oh - oh
For love I will fight like a warrior

Lyrics:

How many times, how many times, how many times
I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Oh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times How many times
Our sister our sister Mary real love she used to tell us about this in the 90's
I used to say that'll never be no never never me
But it's 2011 and I feel I can't get any lower
Taking out my anger out on any and everybody that comes around me
I've become so hard to deal with
'Cause this point of my heart is so tired
How many times How many times How many times ooohhh
I caught you on the phone with her",4165,253,0,1,104720,2011-05-18 21:16:32,1,"k.michelle maybe i should call, k michelle, k michelle how many times lyrics, K.Michelle cant raise a man, acoustic, music, KMichelleVEVO, k michelle hard to do, instrumental, KM, vevo, K.Michelle official, Signed sealed delivered, K.Michelle vevo, k.michelle cry, official, K.Michelle, download, karaoke, remix, how many times live, k.michelle How many times, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, K.michelle hq, Sony, K.Michelle live, em",K.

Make It Up As I Go | Lyrics

I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don’t know what I’m chasing
I don’t know who I am

Woke up this morning holding my head
Thinking last night is one I’ll regret
Washing off the bad decisions / the blurry vision
The clues that I’m still a mess
Spitting out the taste I have in my mouth
Knowing what this all is really about
Knowing there’s an explanation / an expiration
I gotta figure shit out
 
And they’re asking me / if I can see / the darkness down below
And I know it’s true / I say I do / when half the time I don’t
Maybe I can’t make / what it may take / to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes / and cross each line / and every time
 
I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don’t know what I’m chasing
I don’t know who I am
 
Waking in the dead of night I can’t sleep
Sleeping in the light of day for like weeks
Reality was out of focus
I could be hopeless
Instead I gritted my teeth
I didn’t have the patience left to explain
Didn’t wanna wait while nobody came
I know the path ahead’s uneven
But while I’m breathing
I have to make my own lane

And they’re asking me / if I can see / the darkness down below
And I know it’s true / I say I do / when half the time I don’t
Maybe I can’t make / what it may take / to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes / and cross each line / and every time

I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don’t know what I’m chasing
I don’t know who I am

So I make it up as I go (o-oh, o-oh)
I make it up as I go (o-oh, o-oh)
So I make it up as I go (o-oh, o-oh)

0,Am4d3usM0z4rt,16,xxNoneFoundxx,0,"The String Quartet No. 14 in G major, K. 387, nicknamed the ""Spring"" quartet, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1782 while in Vienna. In the composer's inscription on the title page of the autograph score is stated: ""li 31 di decembre 1782 in vienna"". The work was perhaps edited in 1783. This is the first of the Haydn Quartets, a set of six string quartets he wrote during his first few years in Vienna in honor of the composer Joseph Haydn, who is generally viewed as the father of the string quartet form. As with all later Mozart quartets, this quartet has four movements:
I. Allegro vivace assai
II. Menuetto
III. Andante cantabile, in C major
IV. Molto allegro
The first movement, in G major, contrasts fairly diatonic passages with chromatic runs. According to (Williams, 1997) ""it must come as something of a surprise to anyone examining this quartet just how much chromaticism there is in it."" In contrast to the standard quartet form, which places the minuet as the 3rd movement, this quartet has the minuet as its 2nd movement (another example of this ordering is the String Quartet No. 17). It is a long minuet, written in the tonic key of G major, with its chromatic fourths set apart by note-to-note dynamics changes. The minuet is followed by a slow movement in the subdominant C major, whose theme explores remote key areas.
The fugal theme of four whole notes in the finale points ahead to the finale of Mozart's ""Jupiter"" Symphony of 1788, a movement which also begins with four whole notes that are used in a fugal fashion, in the coda, and it also points back to Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 23 in which the finale is also a fugato based on a theme of four whole notes, which Mozart copied out the first few bars of and was mistakenly entered into Köchel's original catalog as K. 291.

‘Licking An Orchid’ Lyrics:

I can be the only girl for you 
Wanna hold you closer
Can I take you home?
I wanna be the one to hold you closer
Than no one has ever done before

Some call it 
Pain 
Some call it torture
Baby I enjoy it
Please come home

I swear i love you, dearly
No one 
Can hold you 
Closer
Please come home 

Honestly sometimes I get scared 
Lost in my own mind 
Trying to find my self 
In the middle of this contagious world 
I reached inside our mothers womb
To find a piece of you 
Recently i’ve been crying, crying 
Theres a pain deep inside 
But, I’m trying not to lose my 
Only baby girl, to a toxic world 
I crawled back in our mothers womb
To find a piece of you

I can be the only girl for - you 
wanna hold you closer
Can I take you home?
I wanna be the one to hold you closer
Than no one has ever done before

Some call it 
Pain 
Some call it torture
Lately I enjoy it
baby please come home 
I swear i’ll love you dearly
No one can hold you 
Closer

TESTO

Non importa come lo so,
Ma mi fa ridere quando mi guardi
Mentre parli a raffica e ti scende la neve dagli occhi

Forse un giorno ce ne andremo lì,
Sopra a quell’isola da tanti soldi
Bevendo vino e birra e non importa quanto ingrassi

L’amore è tutto quello che ci pare
L’amore è avere armi senza fare male
L’amore è così stupido ma vallo poi a capire
L’amore è solo carte da scoprire

E anche quando sarà chiaro che non c’è più niente
tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre
Anche quando avremmo troppo cose da cambiare
Tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre
Non importa come sarà,
Ma il sesso resta sempre un posto fisso
Per chiuderci nell’ombra del più comodo nascondiglio

Non mi chiedere mai perché…
invece chiedimi, chiedimi tutto
proteggimi dall’alba di un futuro che non conosco

L’amore è tutto quello che ci viene
L’amore è scarpe vecchie che non vuoi buttare
L’amore è così stupido, ma vallo poi a capire
L’amore è solo carte da scoprire

E anche quando sarà chiaro che non c’è più niente
tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre
anche quando avremmo troppo cose sa cambiare
tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre

Quando me ne starò fermo mentre hai voglia di ballare
quando tutto cambia senso e non ha senso più aspettare
anche quando sarà chiaro che non c’è più niente
Tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre

Perché parlo di te da gennaio a dicembre
ecco parlo di te… ah ah
ecco parlo di te
sì, io parlo di te

E anche quando sarà chiaro che non c’è più niente
tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre
e anche quando avremmo troppo cose sa cambiare
tu credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi, credimi sempre

Quando me ne starò fermo mentre hai voglia di ballare
quando tutto cambia senso e non ha senso più aspettare

Lyrics: 

Aiyyo, you betta flee Hobbes, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rapper's hearts pumpin like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be large if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go poom-poom, and yo' guns go pow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smokin
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopie
I run with sturdy clicks I'm never hittin dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on

Com ja sabeu hem decidit cedir la meitat dels drets de cada cançó a un col·lectiu amic. Col·lectivitzar la nostra música. 

Aquesta cançó servirà per acompanyar la feina de ★ l’Obra social de la PAH ★

La campanya de l'Obra Social de la PAH, nascuda l'any 2011, reivindica i posa en pràctica la reapropiació ciutadana d'aquells habitatges buits en mans d'entitats financeres i grans propietaris. La campanya té com a objectiu aconseguir una solució habitacional per les milers de famílies que s'han vist desnonades de casa seva, no poden accedir a un lloguer i l'administració ha estat incapaç de donar-los una alternativa digna i estable. A Catalunya, l'Obra Social de la PAH, ha ocupat col·lectivament més de 20 blocs de pisos on hi viuen reallotjades desenes de famílies. En total, a l'estat espanyol ja són més de 50 els blocs recuperats i milers de famílies que ocupen de forma individual arreu del territori per tal de recuperar la funció social dels habitatges buits i posar el dret a una vida digna per davant dels interessos econòmics de bancs, entitats financeres i fons voltors.

se credi agli occhi potrai vedere...

Je me sentais si désemparée...
Je n'ai rien vu venir tu sais...
Il a su m'apporter c'qu'il me fallait quand tu n'étais pas là... Mon cher

C'est un amour, il est tendre et attentionné
Il me donne tout, ce qu'avec toi je n'avais.
C'est un amour, il a tout pour me faire rêver.
Il me donne tout, même plus que je n'espérais.

Bébé, la page est trop tournée
Je ne peux plus reculer tu sais
Au fond je sais que tu t'y attendais, 
Tu n'as rien fait et voilà je m'en vais

Toute seule, à t'attendre toutes ces nuits...
Toute seule, j'ai supporté mais c'est fini !
Toute seule, comme une grande je vais m'en aller.
Je suis seule
Je sais que lui je l'aime

Si tu pensais que je n'me relèverais pas, sur moi tu t'étais trompé !
J'ai envie de crier à quel point je l'aime, et ça c'est inespéré !

Je n'aurais plus à pleurer désormais je suis comblée. Il s'occupe de moi,
il ne pense qu'à moi.
J'ai perdu bien trop d'années, en restant à tes côtés.
Aujourd'hui, je vis, et ma vie c'est lui...

LA TERRA, L'EMILIA, LA LUNA

Madonna che silenzio che c'è stasera
sotto un cielo d'argento tra la ferrovia e la nuova moschea.
Da una macchina arriva della musica elettronica del Nord Africa,
io cerco un centro di gravità almeno momentanea.
La terra, l'Emilia, la Luna 
io e te in un temporale interminabile in Sudamerica.

Sono come la Germania o come la Turchia o come la Grecia, 
come una notte passata in strada o passata in webcam. 
Sono un insieme di violenze e di speranze,
sono un rumore di scontri e di feste, di scontri e di feste. 
 
Madonna che silenzio tra la luna e il nord Italia
tra una chiesa, un castello e una strada sterrata. 
Da una finestra arriva della musica elettronica dell'Est Europa,
io cerco un centro di gravità almeno momentanea.
La Terra, l'Emilia, la Luna
io e te davanti al monumento dei cuori strappati appena fuori  Cracovia.

Dammi solo quello che mi disorienta
una cantilena per quelli che dormono in macchina
e ci sia acqua per tutti quelli che come te vanno per deserti
per tutti quelli che sono morti come sono vissuti 
felicemente felicemente felicemente e al di sopra dei loro mezzi

From the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden comes this spectacular production of Gaetano Donizetti’s wonderful L’Elisir d’Amore (Der Liebestrank). Set in the scenario of a Western Film Production, this is the second directorial work of Rolando Villazón (after his directorial debut in 2011 “Werther”/Lyon). Villazòn as director and Nemorino: these tidings alone were enough to unleash a worldwide ""run"" on tickets to the Baden-Baden 2012 Pentecost-holiday opera.

Aujourd'hui, de nombreux experts s'accordent pour affirmer que notre restauration n'a jamais été autant standardisée : poissons surgelés, souris d'agneau en sauce sous vide et desserts sont entièrement fabriqués en usine. Aujourd'hui, 7 établissements sur 10 utiliseraient des produits industriels pour réaliser leurs recettes. Leurs poubelles débordent de boîtes de conserve et d'emballages plastiques aux couleurs des grandes marques. La filière agro-alimentaire s'est imposée dans la restauration commerciale.

Lyrics:
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake

I’m wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I’m wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong

I’m wide awake
And now it’s clear to me
That everything you see
Ain’t always what it seems
I’m wide awake
Yeah, I was dreamin’ for so long

(Pre-Chorus)
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn’t dive in
Wouldn’t bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
‘Til I woke up on
On the concrete

(Chorus)
Fallin’ from cloud 9
Crashin’ from the high
I’m lettin’ go tonight
Yeah I’m fallin’ from cloud 9
I’m wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I’m wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I’m wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion’s den
I don’t have to pretend
And it’s too late
The story’s over now, the end

(Pre-Chorus)
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn’t dive in
Wouldn’t bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
‘Til I woke up on
On the concrete

(Chorus)
Fallin’ from cloud 9
(It was outta the blue, I’m)
Crashin’ from the high
I’m lettin’ go tonight
(Yeah, I’m lettin’ you go, I’m)
I’m fallin’ from cloud 9

(Bridge)
I’m wide awake
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I’m wide awake
I am trying to hold on
I’m wide awake
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
I’m wide awake
I’m not blind anymore
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake

(Chorus)
Yeah I’m fallin’ from cloud 9
(It was outta the blue, I’m)
Crashin’ from the high
You know I’m letting go tonight
(Yeah, I’m lettin’ you go, I’m)
I’m fallin’ from cloud 9
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake

Someone asked for the lyrics to be added to the description as well. So here they are:

I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that’s held in your arms

And what do you think you’d ever say
I won’t listen anyway
You don’t know me
And I’ll never be what you want me to be

And what do you think you’d understand
I’m a boy
No, I’m a man
You can’t take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what’s never shown
Yeah you stand here on your own
They don’t know me
Cuz I’m not here

And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don’t feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They’re the ones that stay the same
They don’t know me
Cuz I’m not here

And you see the things they never see
All you wanted I could be
Now you know me and I’m not afraid
And I wanna tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man
They can’t break me
As long as I know who I am

And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don’t feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They’re the ones that stay the same
They can’t see me
But I’m still here

They can’t tell me who to be
Cuz I’m not what they see
Yeah, the world is still sleeping
While I keep on dreaming for me
And their words are just whispers and lies
That I’ll never believe

And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don’t feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can they say I’ll never change
They’re the ones that stay the same
I’m the one now
Cuz I’m still here
I’m the one
Cuz I’m still here
I’m still here
I’m still here

Snoopy, the world's most lovable beagle - and flying ace - embarks upon his greatest mission as he takes to the skies to pursue his arch-nemesis The Red Baron, while his best pal, Charlie Brown, begins his own epic quest. From the imagination of Charles M. Schulz and the creators of the ICE AGE films, THE PEANUTS MOVIE will prove that every underdog has his day.

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Lyrics:

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain

And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

(Tired of bein' alone) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguin on the phone) Yeah, yeah
(Are you tellin' all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your n***a don't understand) My love

Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Girl, I've been thinkin' bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets
Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they've been lookin' at me, smilin' at me, laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin', ever growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this s**t for nuttin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't f**k with your baby",19450,245,0,1,379183,2009-10-03 04:42:26,1,"jennifer lopez i'm real official music video, jennifer lopez, acoustic, music, jennifer lopez i'm real karaoke, Jennifer Lopez I'm Real, papi, instrumental, jennifer lopez i'm real clean, Jennifer Lopez I'm Real live, jlo, vevo, official, on the floor, download, karaoke, remix, I'm Real lyrics, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, feel the light, dance again, Sony, jennifer lopez songs, jennifer lopez i'm real original, I'm Real live, jenny",Jennifer Lopez - I'm Real (Remix) ft.

The song elicited a range of reactions, racking up over 15 million YouTube views and netting a No. 15 slot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart along the way. As Lucas explains to Genius, the track was designed to stir up people’s emotions.

Rag'n'Bone Man - Human (Lyrics)

Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind 
Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind

But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me  

Take a look in the mirror and what do you see
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe 
 
Cos I'm only human after all, you're only human after all 
Don't put the blame on me 
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems 
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them 
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me 

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, making you cry

Cos I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me, don't put the blame on me

Some people got the real problems 
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them 
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me

""Feeling Good"" Lyrics:

Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good

Official Lyrics:
Who are you to say, that I didn’t love you
Cuz I didn’t love the way you wanted
And who am I to blame, when I didn’t trust you 
Enough to let you in the way I wanted
(stop, okay)
 
Vodka on my lips
Took too many drinks
Makes me reminisce all the way down
To my happy place
You’re my happy place
I can’t handle us now
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard 
Cuz things didn’t work out in this life but someday 
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, heaven or high water 
Cuz things didn’t turn out in this life but maybe 
If I’m lucky. Eh.
If I’m lucky. Eh.
I get your lovin. (yeah)
Cuz things didn’t work out in this life but someday 
 
Who am I to say, that it wasn’t good babe
Just thinking bout our lovin gives me chills 
Up and down my spine, I dare you not to miss me 
Cuz what we had was more than just a (thrill)
(stop, okay) 
 
Vodka on my lips
Took too many drinks
Makes me reminisce all the way down
To my happy place
You’re my happy place
I can’t handle us now
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard 
Cuz things didn’t work out in this life but someday 
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, heaven or high water 
Cuz things didn’t turn out in this life but maybe 
If I’m lucky. Eh.
If I’m lucky. Eh.
I get your lovin, miss when you say (yeah) - I really miss it babe 
Cuz things didn’t work out in this life but someday
I’m selfish for you. Ooh.
I’m selfish for you. Ooh.
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, 
If I’m lucky I’ll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard

Lyrics:
Giờ này mặt trời của anh đã là ai
Vì giờ này trong trái tim em là anh
Và rồi người có thấy ko
Are you tired?
Sao cứ vòng quanh ở trong tâm trí em

Kể từ ngày anh đến đây tim em vụn vỡ
Chợt nhiều lần ôm lấy anh tỉnh giấc lại mơ
Và rồi người có thể chờ
Hay có thấy giờ
Trái tim em lạc rơi nơi nào
Vậy người em yêu hỡi
Biết đâu đến mai mình thành đôi
Chẳng còn nơi đây một mình
Tình yêu khi xưa đã trao trong giấc mộng say
Vì vậy xin anh hãy
Đến đây với em dù là phút giây
Để em nói với anh rằng
I love you

[Rap]
Lỡ gặp anh vào 1 ngày trời đầy nắng và gió
Phố đông người qua em chẳng dám ngỏ lời yêu anh từ cái nhìn đầu tiên thoáng thấy môi cười tựa nắng
Lòng em với bao muộn phiền này anh bảo mây trôi nhanh đừng ở đây che mất mặt trời của em là anh
Lạc giữa mê cung tâm trí chìm vào ánh mắt của anh thật lâu em mất luôn cả định vị
Làm sao để đến với anh khi mà tên em anh cũng chẳng biết là gì
Tim em loạn nhịp liên hồi giờ làm sao đây em biết là mình đã yêu rồi

It’s so hard to love me babe babe?

I go crazy because of you, hey boy

My heart beats fast when I’m thinking of you

Don’t know why I miss you all day and night

Is it so hard

N.Flying was much loved by fans as the group gave off the fun and exciting energy with the songs including ‘The Real’ and ‘Hot Potato’. This album shows a wider musical spectrum of N.Flying with its title track ‘HOW R U TODAY’ as it interpreted the subject breakup in its unique way. ‘HOW R U TODAY’ is an alternative pop song with a sentimental feeling that describes the lonely message of a man who hasn’t forgotten the person who’s left in the form of letter.

N’to is finally back with a brand new release on Hungry Music and his mission is to wave an exciting summer season goodbye in perfect style. His latest two-track endeavor features handcrafted sounds and lush grooves. 

La Clé Des Champs is an arpeggiated excursion into N’to’s world of deep frequencies and mesmerizing pads. Crisp hi-hat patterns gently provide the energy, while thick moog-ish melodies set the vibe.

The laid back, charismatic In The Mood For Noune composition is the perfect soundtrack for a late summer evening. Built around a slow jamming groove and funky shakers, the earthy tones dance wonderfully alongside the sparkling & heartfelt keys.",564,416,0,1,22750,2016-09-30 11:47:42,0,"Hungry, Music, N'to, Nto, La Clé Des Champs, Electronica, in the mood for noune",N'to - La Clé Des Champs,qd_8mm906GA,2410616,CJYBEAA,n,0,16,9,30,274,4,6.3821280347809735,2.8215135284047728,4.356981400993131,2.751279103983342,6,39,0.257177033492823,130,0.0,6,0.0,5,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0.6826847373240857,0.4420960396012495,1.583620285809982,0,1,7.0

Enregistré le 27 janvier 2018 à l'Auditorium de la Maison de la Radio (Paris).

Le Concerto pour piano n°3 de Beethoven est créé à Vienne le 5 avril 1803, le même jour que l’oratorio Le Christ au mont des Oliviers et la Deuxième Symphonie. Ecrit en ut mineur, tonalité chère à son compositeur, il se découpe en trois mouvements. L’Allegro con brio s’ouvre sur une longue page orchestrale avec l’exposition des deux thèmes principaux, ensuite repris par le pianiste. Au cours du développement, un dialogue s’établit entre soliste et orchestre. Le mouvement s’achève par une cadence au piano, inspirée du premier thème.

Au cœur du Largo, les arpèges du piano soutiennent le chant entonné conjointement par la flûte et le basson, empreint de sérénité. Gérard Condé suggère une « transposition musicale de la scène du balcon de Roméo et Juliette ». Enfin, dans le Rondo, orchestre et soliste conversent avec vigueur.
« Il s’agit à coup sûr du premier ""grand"" concerto beethovénien […], marquant un progrès très sensible dans l’équilibre entre soliste et orchestre, enfin traités en véritables partenaires », remarque François-René Tranchefort.

Chopin composed his popular Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 when he was about twenty.

This popular nocturne is in rounded binary form (A, A, B, A, B, A) with coda, C. The A and B sections become increasingly ornamented with each recurrence. The penultimate bar utilizes considerable rhythmic freedom, indicated by the instruction, senza tempo (without tempo). Nocturne in E-flat major opens with a legato melody, mostly played piano, containing graceful upward leaps which becomes increasingly wide as the line unfolds. This melody is heard again three times during the piece. With each repetition, it is varied by ever more elaborate decorative tones and trills. The nocturne also includes a subordinate melody, which is played with rubato.",11698,270,0,1,604683,2013-06-19 10:46:07,0,"Frédéric Chopin (Author), Op. 9 No. 2: Andante nocturne op.9 No.2 andante notturno, Nocturne (Composition Type), Chopin nocturne, Frédéric Chopin (Composer), Vadim Chaimovich",Chopin - Nocturne op.9 No.2,9E6b3swbnWg,83721508,CJYBEAA,n,0,13,6,19,170,2,7.9228370422918335,4.4589549570218665,5.781527759064063,4.068111617027303,7,25,0.28875,131,0.0,5,0.0,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,4,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,27,0.7297294805134152,0.5627977621172967,1.421182185578479,0,0,7.0

Текст:

И то, что было, набело
Откроется потом
Мой рок'н'ролл -  
Это не цель и даже не средство

Не новое, а заново
Один и об одном
Дорога в мой дом
И для любви это не место

Прольются все слова как дождь
И там, где ты меня не ждёшь
Ночные ветры принесут тебе прохладу
На наших лицах без ответа 
Лишь только отблески рассвета
Того, где ты меня не ждёшь 

А дальше -это главное
Похожий на тебя
В долгом пути
Я заплету волосы лентой

И неспособный на покой
Я знак подам тебе рукой
Прощаюсь с тобой
Как будто с легендой

Прольются все слова как дождь
И там, где ты меня не ждёшь

In his six Suites for unaccompanied violoncello, J. S. Bach invented a style that is specific to that instrument, while exploring all its technical possibilities to the full. Over the years, the Suites have become a monument of the cello repertoire, to which all cellists return regularly. Some of the greatest of them did not record these works until they reached their years of maturity (Casals was over sixty, Rostropovich was sixty-three), while others have not hesitated to present several versions (Yo-Yo Ma, 1990, 1998; Janos Starker, 1957, 1963, 1983). Ophélie Gaillard is among the latter. Her first recording of the Suites, released on the Ambrosia label in 2000, was highly acclaimed internationally by the critics and her performance earned her a French Classical Music Award (Victoire) as a ""Revelation"" in the Solo Instrumentalist category. Ten years later, at the request of Nicolas Bartholomée, artistic director of the label, she agreed to record a new version on a cello made in 1737 by Matteo Goffriller, a contemporary of J. S. Bach. Ophélie Gaillard had already given us a reference performance of these pieces. Now we discover a prodigiously renewed vision of this masterpiece."" http://eboutique.harmoniamundi.com/johann-sebastian-bach-cello-suites.html Recording producer: Nicolas Bartholomée Film director: Guillaume L'Hôte Filmed at Grenier de la Mothe, Bailleul Neuville http://www.littletribeca.com",365,177,0,1,20417,2011-05-18 09:54:25,0,"classical, cello, bach, ophélie, gaillard, classical music, aparté, little, tribeca, guillaume, l'hôte, suites, bwv, 1007, major, CIC, goffriller, prélude","Ophélie Gaillard, Bach, Prelude, Cello suite n. 1",poCw2CCrfzA,2094825,CPoBEAA,n,0,11,5,18,138,2,6.321147748205036,1.7923916894982541,4.30999192878118,2.562292864456474,6,20,0.1331313131313131,213,-0.03125,17,0.0,7,0,3,0,1,2,5,0,0,2,3,0,0,6,0,1,1,1,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,49,0.6818369227337002,0.28355478481059465,1.6820840383113018,0,0,7.0

0,Indian Records South,89,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"A rare evergreen Carnatic Instrumental collection “Dr.N.Ramani: When the Flute Sings” is going to mesmerize our listeners. Dr. N. Ramani performed his first concert at the age of 8. Dr.N.Ramani performed in all major states, sabhas and venues throughout India, as well as numerous destinations around the world, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sri Lanka and other countries. He made more than 30 concert tours outside of India. Ramani was born in Tiruvarur, a city in Tamil Nadu which is honored by its association with the Trinity of Carnatic music. Ramani was born into a family of flautists. Ramani first learnt music from his grandfather, Sri Aazhiyur Narayanaswami Iyer, a well-known flute artist and singer himself. Aware of young Ramani's keen interest in the Carnatic flute, Dr.N.Ramani's initiation to Carnatic music began at the age of five.
The evergreen Carnatic Instrumental collection “Dr.N.Ramani: When the Flute Sings” is a rare collection of Tamil songs. It is a compilation of very popular Carnatic Instrumentals such as Thaye Yesoda (Flute), Enna Thavam (Flute) and Theeradha Vilayattu Pillai (Flute).

JWP/BC ""20"" mixtape to wyjątkowy materiał, jaki przygotowaliśmy dla Was z okazji 20-lecia składu JWP. Znajdziecie na nim wiele premierowych i nigdy nie publikowanych utworów. Są tam zarówno nowości, jak też archiwalne tracki, które z różnych względów nie trafiły na wcześniejsze płyty i winylowe EP-ki.

So you say let me buy you a drink
Or let a conversation
If that's what you want to do (do-do)
And she said love is about to end
And you said welcome to my crib
And She said I can't leave my friends

Lyrics:

Damn lil' mama, you thought Akon and T-Pain was the only ones in love wit a stripper?
Forgot to mention Twista, Pimp C, Paul Wall, MJG, Too $hort?
You know we had to remix this

She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that
Super-cute face and the booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Cuz I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never go back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown can't leave it alone
Liking the way she break it down to the flo'
Need to get her over here show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper

You wanna know where Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun 2001, in these pocket all my e-fizzles with me
I like the way mama get up on the table
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole
Look at the Laffy Taffy when she pop, she roll
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video you get the popular role
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man
She freakin' she lickin' she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home (Down right now)

I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it

Even though your winds blow
I want you to know
You cause me no alarm
Cause I'm safe in his arms

Even though your rain falls
I can still make this call;
Let there be peace

I command you to move today

The sun will shine - and I will be okay

Storm you can't last (oh oh, you've got to go away)
Go away - I command you to move today
Storm - when God speaks; (when God speaks, you don't have a choice in the matter)
Storm - you've got to cease
That's what I told storm!

Wind stop blowing!
Flood stop flowing!
Lightning stop flashing!
Breakers stop dashing!
Darkness go away!
Clouds move away!

O Nosso Santo Bateu
(Matheus Aleixo/ Pacheco)

Às vezes acho que devia te dizer mais vezes
Que te amo e que te quero mais que qualquer coisa
Por essa noite vem morar aqui

Tem gente que chega e muda os planos da gente
E que faz a nossa vida caminhar pra frente
Agora, sim, eu sei pra onde ir

Dessa vida nada se leva
E no fundo todo mundo espera
Um amor que venha pra somar, pra completar

O nosso santo bateu
O amor da sua vida sou eu
Tudo que é meu hoje é seu
E o fim nem precisa rimar

Lyrics:

I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's gotta give
As sharing in this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you but how could I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not fair

Cuz I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing at all",4614,253,0,1,99642,2009-10-25 08:42:09,1,"All Or Nothing lyrics, O-Town, boyband, acoustic, music, new song, O-Town live, hd, we fit together, funk, vevo, OTownVevo, official, download, o town, O-Town All Or Nothing, songs, karaoke, remix, liquid dreams, lyrics, these are the days, official video, cover, All Or Nothing live, O-Town All Or Nothing official, original, O-Town lyrics, Sony, music video, single, album, full album, live, the painter, hq, All or Nothing, J Records, Pop",O-Town - All Or Nothing,TG8IkUoZ6j0,29534020,CJYBEAA,o,0,9,10,25,298,6,7.470322564641794,3.8330833341783435,4.998442436048799,3.6640775901850753,7,43,0.2683080808080808,170,0.19987824675324672,38,0.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,23,0.6691066406833902,0.5131081423874421,1.364174833370907,1,0,7.0

O Nosso Santo Bateu
(Matheus Aleixo / Pacheco)

Às vezes acho que devia te dizer mais vezes
Que te amo e que te quero mais que qualquer coisa
Por essa noite vem morar aqui, aqui, vem
Tem gente que chega e muda os planos da gente
E que faz a nossa vida caminhar pra frente
Agora sim eu sei pra onde ir

Dessa vida nada se leva
E no fundo todo mundo espera
Um amor que venha pra somar, pra completar

O nosso santo bateu
O amor da sua vida sou eu
Tudo que é meu hoje é seu
E o fim nem precisa rimar

LYRICS:

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine

Ooh yes it was
Ooh it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
It was a holy holy holy, oh oh oh

Lyrics:

Money, money, money, money, money [6x]
Some people got to have it
Some people really need it
Listen to me y'all, do things
Do things, do bad things with it
You wanna do things, do things
Do things, good things with it
Talk about cash money, money
Talk about cash money
Dollar bills, yall

For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know
Who in the world they're gonna beat
For that lean, mean, mean green
Almighty dollar, money

Original Lyrics:

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night divine, O night, O night Divine.
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here come the wise men from the Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend.
He knows our need, to our weaknesses no stranger,
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
His power and glory evermore proclaim.
His power and glory evermore proclaim.

Prepara que eu já tô me preparando

O terceiro é se arrepender

O Come All Ye Faithful Lyrics:

O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

O Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.
Give to our Father glory in the Highest;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

""Dragostea Din Tei"" è una della tante hit della dance band moldava O-Zone. La loro storia è cominciata nella Repubblica Moldava, dove Dan, Arsenie e Radu hanno conosciuto i loro primi successi musicali. In questo modo si sono convinti che la musica pop rumena poteva essere interessante x quanto riguarda il mercato europeo e potevano esserci i presupposti per l'inizio di una carriera Internazionale. Ecco perché nel 2002 gli O-Zone hanno dato un loro demo a Dan Popi un manager di un'etichetta discografica rumena nel quale hanno riposto la loro fiducia. Il loro primo singolo in Romania è stato: ""Numai Tu"" tratto dal loro album ""Number 1"". Numai Tu ha conquistato le classifiche radio e la Top 100 rumena. Nell'autunno 2002 gli O-zone tornano con un nuovo singolo ""Despre Tine"" e le nuove stelle della musica dance si accorgono di aver contaminato sia le radio sia le televisioni della Romania con ""l'O-Zone Mania"".

""Dragostea Din Tei"" by O-Zone was one of the most played singles by the Italian radio stations and reached NR 1 in all the European sales charts: Nr 1 in France for 15 weeks (Platinum Record), Nr 1 in Spain, Nr 1 in Germany (Platinum Record), Nr 3 in the UK, Nr 1 in Belgium (Platinum Record), Nr 1 in Holland (Platinum Record), Nr 1 in Norway (Platinum Record in 2 week), Nr 1 in Austria, Switzerland and in all the Eastern European Countries (...)

Vas caminando despacio, sin ganas de sonreir, de sonreir
Hemos quedado en el barrio,unos litros y cien duros de hachis
Perdidos en cualqier lado, sonando con escapar, con escapar
La mayoria del paro, y el que curra del trabajo temporal
Han pasado 10 anos, mis colegas donde estan
El que no anda en el mako, hace poco lo acabaron de enterar
La heroina no acudio a su funeral

Eh chaval siempre A la sombra de la sociedad
Somos la causa de su malestar
Esculpele al sistema Y nunca dejes de molestar
No chaval no es ley de vida, tu desigualdad
No te dieron la oportunidad
Esculpele al sistema Y nunca dejes de molestar

Lyrics:

I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support,
There's a shortage in the switch,
I can't stay on your morphine,
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch,
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointing up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And your sold us down the river too far

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disasters?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willing, we came when you called
But then you fooled us, enough is enough

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disasters?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disasters?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
And now it's time to let them know

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disasters?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

What about us?
What about us?
What about us?

LYRICS

Heaven knows that I’m born too late for these ghosts that I
chase with these dreams I inflate painted skies in my 
brain every day I’m Carl Sagan in space to escape 
This old world
This old world

Somedays I lie wide awake till the sun hits my
face and I fade elevate from the earth far 
away to a place where I’m free from the weight 
This old world 
This old world

I don’t trust anything 
Or anyone 
Below the sun
I don’t feel anything 
At all

I’m King of the clouds
Of the clouds
I get lifted 
I get lifted 
King of the clouds
Of the clouds
I get lifted 
I get lifted

Some only live to die I’m alive to fly higher than 
Angels in outfields inside of my mind I’m 
Ascending these ladders i’m climbin’ say goodbye 
This old world 
This old world

And when 
I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes in the 
Backbone of night I’m combustible dust in the 
Fire when I can’t sleep a wink I’m too tired
This old world 
This old world

I don’t trust anything 
Or anyone 
Below the sun
I don’t feel anything 
At all

I’m King of the clouds
Of the clouds
I get lifted 
I get lifted 
King of the clouds
Of the clouds
I get lifted 
I get lifted

Take me somewhere I 
Don’t know

But I better find it 
alone

Lyrics:

I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him-his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the """"Roche""""
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said""",39716,340,0,1,1206306,2013-12-06 08:00:01,1,"Daft Punk, Daft Punk vevo, DaftPunkvevo, acoustic, music, vevo, instrumental, Daft Punk Instant Crush, video, Daft Punk one more time, Daft Punk Instant Crush lyrics, Daft Punk pentatonix, official, featuring Julian Casablancas, Julian Casablancas, download, Daft Punk Instant Crush live, Random Access Memories, Daft punk within, dance, Daft punk touch, electronic, karaoke, remix, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, Daft, Punk, Instant, Crush",Daft Punk - Instant Crush (Video) ft.

Lyrics:
One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

Sigma's recent No.1 hit, 'Nobody To Love', has quickly become one of 2014's highest-selling singles so far, clocking up 510,000 sales (including streams), 30 million YouTube views and 40 million worldwide streams. And how do you follow-up a single that's hit No.1 in 8 countries? If you're Sigma, you go straight into the studio, call up Paloma Faith and a full orchestra, and produce a monster hit-in-waiting in 'Changing'. 

Premiered on Radio 1 courtesy of Annie Mac (Special Delivery, 11/7/14), 'Changing' shows Sigma aka Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie in sparkling form, making good use of studio time in between a packed summer schedule with shows across the UK, Europe, North America and Australia, including Glastonbury, Global Gathering, Ibiza Rocks and Bestival.

Sigma's remixes for Kiesza ('Hideaway'), Route 94 ('My Love'), Clean Bandit ('Extraordinary'), DJ Fresh ('Dibby Dibby Sound') and DJ Zinc ('Show Me') have helped make 2014 their best year to date, further proof that the UK duo have big intentions ahead of the artist album they're currently putting the finishing touches to.

Leeds University alumni -- alongside Rusko -- Sigma met while balancing raving and studying, working in record shops and promoting events to top up their student loans. While some don their artist mantle when the occasion demands it, Cameron and Joe have made Sigma their 'life' since graduation. Early releases with Hospital Records, Viper, Bingo and DJ Fresh's Breakbeat Kaos, as well as their own Life Recordings, quickly marked them out as producers to watch, while remixes for Eric Prydz, Ellie Goulding, Stylo G and Sway began to take them to a wider audience. The world, it seems, is now their oyster.

Three-time BRIT nominee Paloma Faith released her third album 'A Perfect Contradiction' on March 10, the follow-up to 2012's double platinum selling 'Fall To Grace', and her debut 'Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful?' (also double platinum).

Lyrics:
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 AM, summer night
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that

Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'm a fuck the world
I'mma be on tunes 'til God re-furls
You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk driving, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help

Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight

Wait hold up, back in this mothafuckin' bitch once again
It's the pretty mothafucka with a 40 ounce of brew
My nigga Q and we drunker than a bitch
We gettin' millis mothafucka yeah, uh
Nigga weed and brews, unbelieveable
Got a freak or two, in my vehicle
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink
Then we mix it up, call it Pikachu
With a little bit of crack, little bit of dope
Little bit of smoke, little coke
Little weed, when they on them pills
Little bit of E, little bit of shrooms
Little bit of deuce, what it do, hand on the wheels
And I keep the illest, trillest bitches while I'm swaggin' it
Crush a bit, little bit, that's my pursuit of happiness

If I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
If I fucked her twice, I might change her life
If I change her life she might hit my weed
We could have a some and we could run off with three
Her, Mary and me, I'll keep it strictly G

TJ Hertz’s first original release since 2014’s critically acclaimed Flatland comes in the form of Objekt #4, a continuation of his club-focused white label series and a tribute to the sadly now defunct Basement Q, a formative and beloved haunt in Berlin’s Schöneberg district which quietly but profoundly shaped the musical identities of Hertz and several of his contemporaries until its final closure in 2012. 

“There really was no place quite like it,” remembers Hertz. “Even in the later years when Joe [Call Super] and I would go, the sense of vitality was palpable; you had all these regulars who must all have been pushing 50 years old but still had more energy and passion than any 25 year olds we knew at the time. God only knows what it must’ve been like in the 80s when it opened. I think it changed a bit over the years but I know the horse fresco on the ceiling was there from the start and the custom-built soundsystem too. Bogdan, the sage and amiable but somehow kinda unhinged old Bulgarian dude that owned and built the place, he had this obsession with right angles; he hated them, said they were fascist or something. So everything was slightly askew and you never quite knew which direction was up, much less when he or Emil or one of the other residents were playing. It was disorientating and beautiful and in the midst of such an experience your eyes would offer your brain no valid explanation for the wonderful confusion of sound that your ears were reporting. Meanwhile this old, fabulous, rave-weathered crowd of 40 to 60 people would be gradually losing their shit, feet glued to the floor but bodies flailing as if caught in a hurricane. It was something else.” 

The two tracks on Objekt #4 pay tribute to two of the many musical facets of Basement Q in its later years. A-side “Needle and Thread” aims to condense several hours of a Thursday night in the Basement into 9 minutes and 26 seconds, embellishing a hypnotic rolling techno backbone with hyper-detailed atmospherics, enchanting melodies and tight, strident breakbeats. B-side “Theme From Q” is Hertz’s reinterpretation of a Basement Q anthem, owner and founder DJ Bogdan’s own “Love Inna Basement (Morning Dub)”, which never saw an official release despite providing the soundtrack to over 20 years of late morning love-ins in the cellar underneath the Sattler & Söhne glue factory. Together, the two tracks offer an incomplete but nonetheless seductive illustration of one of the most idiosyncratic and overlooked clubs in Berlin’s recent history.

Lyrics:

 [Piso 21] 
¿Como podrás respirar 
cuando te falte mi piel?
 Si fuiste tú quien se alejó 
Pero esta vez no me dolió baby (No me dolió) 
No quiero verte llorar por mi 
Entiendo no sabes perder Aunque esta vez… 

[Manuel Turizo]
 No va a ser tan fácil 
Yo te lo juro no va a ser tan fácil (No va a ser tan fácil) 
Lo hiciste difícil
 Lo tengo claro si pregunta por ti diré. 

[Piso 21] 
Volverá como la primera vez 
Déjala que vuelva 
Ella conoce solita el camino conmigo. 

[Manuel Turizo] 
Volverá como la primera vez 
Déjala que vuelva 
Ella conoce solita el camino conmigo. 

[Piso 21] 
Tu cuerpo, sabes que no dejo de pensar en tus besos 
No hay nada más rico que probar tu boca 
Pero esta vez mamacita no está fácil la cosa. 
Tu cuerpo, sabes que no dejo de pensar en tus besos 
No hay nada más rico que probar tu boca 
Pero esta vez mamacita no está fácil la cosa.

 [Manuel Turizo] 
Volverá como la primera vez 
Déjala que vuelva 
Ella conoce solita el camino conmigo. 

[Piso 21] 
Volverá como la primera vez 
Déjala que vuelva 
Ella conoce solita el camino conmigo. 

[Manuel Turizo]
Baby yo sé que tú también me das 
Lo que es lo quieres
 Yo sé que es lo que tú quieres 
Que yo me desespere y te vuelva a ver. 
Por favor no le insistas 
Déjala que juegue sola ya no le insistías 
Sientes que por volver a ella mueres 
Esta vez no le daré lo que ella quiere. 

[Piso 21]
 Volverá como la primera vez 
Déjala que vuelva 
Ella conoce solita el camino conmigo.

My album is a story of triumph, of letting go of all the uncertainty in my head and learning to walk the path of my own heart. “Sincerely” is about realizing how much better this world would be if we all loved ourselves, if we weren’t afraid of being vulnerable and honest. It doesn’t matter who’s president or what technology we invent or what extremists we destroy, the only thing I know is this:

There will never be peace if we do not all love ourselves.

• Wells' earlier expedition in 1998 had provided blood samples from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan and he reconnects with a man named Niyazov -a Kazakh Turk who lives in Kazakhstan near the border of Kirgyzistan. Niyazov has African markers that go back 2000 generations and also has an important Y chromosome marker called P-M45, which is ancestral to R-M207 and Q-M242. That indicates Central Asia is where M45 originated and where both Europeans and Native Americans were descendant from. Niyazov is descended in an unbroken line from the people who originally occupied Central Asia 40 000 years ago.

• Dr. Spencer Wells who wrote a book titled ""Journey of Man"" claims he has evidence based on the Y-Chromosome tests, the first group followed the coast line of southern Asia all the way to Australia 50.000 years ago after Africa. Another group about 40.000 years ago walked again but took an inland route and first settled in Kazakhstan. This group then spread to west thru Russia, some to China and some to Siberia and Alaska, North&South America and some to Pakistan/India. He states that he identified the M9 ""Central asian"" marker which first occurred among people of Central Asian (Turkestan) steppes 40.000 years ago. He claims that a man named Niyazov (a Kazak Turk) has the M9 but no subsequent markers, therefore he must have descended in an unbroken line from the people who originally occupied Central Asia 40.000 years ago. Wells states that Niyazov's gene was the father to most Europeans, most Asians, most Indians and many Native Americans.

• Apparently there are 2 subspecies of our species, a tropical one and a temperate one. The tropical subspecies is represented by sub-Saharan Africans, Melanesians, Australian Aborigines, and some Dravidians. The temperate subspecies includes all the rest of the world peoples, descended from one man who lived in Kazakhstan about 40,000 years ago.

• CHRONOLOGY:

• Caves in Southern France show the first to arrive in Europe: the Cro Magnon. They arrived from Africa 35,000 YA. They had a cold, dark life which explains lighter skin adaptations.

• One nomadic group left Khazakstan (central Asia) straight northeast into the Ice Age. 13,000 YA they crossed an ice sheet into Alaska. These descendants of Siberia (10-20 individuals) made their way down the American west coast over 800 years.

• Navaho indigenous people have their own Creation Story that say they are from the mountains. Yet they carry the same central Asian genetic marker as Niyazov from Kyrgystan.
____________________________

The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians1, 2, 3, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia9, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers10, 11, 12, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages5. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World.

--------------------------
The presence of haplogroup R1 among Indigenous Americans groups is a matter of controversy. It is now the most common haplogroup after the various Q-M242, especially in North America, highest worldwide R1 rates among Great Lakes/Algonquian-speakers, in Ojibwe people at 79%, Chipewyan 62%, Seminole 50%, Cherokee 47%, Dogrib 40% and Papago 38%.

estoy instalada en la peli q rodamos el sábado
regándose el deseo x el mar mediterráneo

se acercaron dos hombres a vacilar
si se pueden unir? q si pueden mirar?
tu me preguntaste “les conoces”
le metiste un bofetón y así comenzó la noche

ella tiene velvet y encaje en su closet
encaje en su closet
ella tiene velvet y encaje en su closet

eh eh...

estaba lleno de básicos d pelo igual
yo q no quiero ser violenta 
le dije sácame a otro lugar
pero ya x inercia:

bajad del escenario
subid al cadalso
están las raxetas haciendo carpaccio
están las raxetas haciendo carpaccio
con carne del hombre malo!!!


cara de raqueta llevando plata mate
dile q no es artista
dile q es un fraude

te gustan mis anillos en tu cara marcaos?
no vuelvas a ser tan maleducao

arando la tierra, sembrando las rosas
las ciervas despiertan zu Hause
immer Frühling zu Hause 
(en casa es siempre primavera)
esto es lo que yo deseé

contacta mamarracho x tu zona
quiso decir tantas cosas y solo le salió ""zorraaaaaa”

todo está pasao pero ustedes son fieles
contra reaccionarios e intelectuales si?
casi intelectuales
pa daros fuerte ya hay lista de clientes
pa cuando te den y luego 
vayas y lo cuentes 

las pasiones + nobles suceden 
de lunes a jueves
llámame para uno de de tus documentales

sueño con ser tu señora
irnos de viaje a la costa brava
estar tres semanas de boda…
tu seniora


poner la radio en el toyota
a noventa con las nike air rotas
con las nike air rotas

me llama al cell me dice ¿q vas a hacer
y yo q estaba aquí prendiendo la fiesta
y yo que estaba, que estaba esperándote
y aunque vengas tarde no me molesta

me dice “no tardo, guarda 1 reggaeton”
llega en silencio y la cara me besa
y yo q estaba poniendo una de Don, King of Kings
me mató con su monogotas de fresa

gritando al dj le dice “ponme a tomasa del real”
sé qué soñaste hace unas semanas
y mira me tienes aquí de verdad

yo se que tu tienes talento, que tu tienes proyectos
que tu estilo es duro pero
 a mi me gusta tierno

me puso en el pelo dos flores
me bailó una de la Dolores

مفيش أسباب
بعدت وعمري ما عملت لبعادنا حساب
أنا سبتك عشان ما اقبلش إني أتساب
مشيت قبل إنت ما تقولي خلاص مليت

جراح في جراح
جرحت أنا نفسي بإيديا عشان أرتاح
بسببك كل شيء كان حلو بينا اهو راح
نهاية حبيبي عكس ما اتمنيت

أوقات بتموت حاجات
علشان نعرف نعيش
وها كمل ليه الحياة
مع قلب ما حبنيش
كان نفسي أعيش جواك
مش بس أعيش وياك
ما تجبش العيب عليا وما تلومنيش

ما كملناش
عملت حاجات كتير قلبك ما قدرهاش
وكنت بموت عشان أرضيك وما بترضاش
وقطر الفرح عدى قصاد عينيا وفات

وهاكدب ليه

Bekannt für ihren ""isorhythmisch funkigen Leichtmetalljazzbarock""
spielt die Band ""SYNDROM Q"" hier
das Stück ""NO THANKS"" des Keyboarders
(mit einem polyphonen Intro des Gitarristen als Bach-Reminiszenz).
Ursprünglich als schnelles Stück geplant
stellte sich bei einer Langsamspielprobe heraus,
daß es so  1. viel mehr groovt
         und  2. die Feinheiten des fraktalen Parlandos der genialen Melodie,
                    (die mich an einen Strandspaziergang erinnert)
                     viel besser zur Geltung kommen.
""NO THANKS"" enthält ein ausgedehntes kraftvolles Solo des Keyboarders
und anschliessend ein melodisch-melancholisches des Gitarristen ,
das offensichtlich über den Wolken spielt...

Glistening, bubble like synths start the tune, and then it settles into a bouncing, intricate drum shuffle that drives a bright, addictive melody. All the layers and textures are all pulled together by a syncopated, buttery-smooth bass line, which expertly compliments Q‘AILA’s unapologetically sultry, soulful vocal lines.

Lyrics:

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you
Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you

Hey pretty mama how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into

Lyrics:

Two years ago, promises is all I heard
Wait a minute, let me finish
Two years ago, promises is all I heard
Out of your mouth
Now you want to walk away boy
And tear down the walls in this house
You used to tell me sweet things
Sweet things in the morning time
Now all you do is hurt me
And think that everything is fine

You better be careful what you say to me
'Cause it might turn around on you
You better be careful what you do to me
'Cause somebody might do it to you

Now who was there for you when your ass was out of work?
All by myself, taking Little Man to church
So quick to hang up the phone, when I step in the room
Then you want to turn it all around
I'm gettin' tired of playin' fool

You better be careful what you say to me
'Cause it might turn around on you
You better be careful what you do to me
'Cause somebody might do it to you

+(R.Kelly)
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

Two years ago, didn't know you had male friends
Wait a minute, let me finish
Two years ago, didn't know you had male friends
Off up in college
I found out you're still reaching out to some of them
Misses Busy Body
You used to listen to me
When you were down and lost
But now, you don't even respect me
Ever since I got laid off

Now who gave you money when your ass was broke, without a dime?
And even though Little Man is not my child, I made him mine, mm hmm
So quick to run to your friends
And talk about, what we do in this house
And then you want to party all night long
What the hell you talkin' 'bout?

0,The FADER,711,en,1,"Naira first emerged on the U.K. scene with ""Marry Juana"" in 2014, a lilting summertime bop using clever wordplay to extoll the virtues of weed. Since then, he’s put out a steady stream of tunes straddling both London and Lagos. His latest single, the delightfully joyous ""Issa Goal,"" has spawned thousands of videos of fans doing the shaku shaku. The track features guest verses from Nigerian stars Kesh and Olamide, and is something of an official-unofficial anthem for Nigeria's soccer team as it prepares to compete in this summer's World Cup. Its video, debuting today on The FADER, is a beautiful, green-and-white celebration in the metropolis of Lagos.

Lyrics :


I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Cause every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

Don't wannna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just want to hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For the rest of time Yeah yeah yeah

I don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

LYRICS:
Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

Lyrics:

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling

Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your hard to miss think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke

0,NPR Music,7504,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"T-Pain's fingerprints are all over pop and R&B and hip-hop. He wasn't the first musician to use Auto-Tune as an instrument — he noticed it on a Jennifer Lopez remix, and remembers ""Deep"" well — but it was, as he says, his style. For a while, in the mid-2000s, he lived at the top of the charts. He dominated that brief moment of our lives when ringtones were a thing. He was celebrated as an innovator, and he happily took his talents where he was invited, which was everywhere.

But somewhere along the way, somebody got it twisted. ""People felt like I was using it to sound good,"" says T-Pain, in an interview that will air on All Things Considered. ""But I was just using it to sound different.”

He just turned 30, but T-Pain has already done enough to drop a greatest hits album next week. We asked him if he'd grace the Tiny Desk without any embellishment or effects to show what's really made his career: his voice, and those songs.--FRANNIE KELLEY

I put you on the front page of the King magazine

See you're too irresistible, yeah that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got ahold on me
No I can't be responsible, responsible

It ain't my fault
No no no no no no no

It ain't my fault you came in looking like that
You just made me trip, fall and land on your lap
Stuntin' bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude,
But I'd look so damn good on ya

Ain't got time right now

Lyrics:

I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And Ican't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore",8825,294,0,1,221654,2012-07-24 20:30:39,1,"reo speedwagon can't fight this feeling, one lonely night, take it on the run, acoustic, riding the storm out, here with me, music, can't fight this feeling lyrics, keep on loving you, instrumental, speedwagon, vevo, roll with the changes, official, greatest hits, download, karaoke, remix, lyrics, audio, official video, cover, can't fight this feeling, reo speedwagon vevo, live 1985, reo speedwagon, Sony, rspwagonvevo, music video, playlist",REO Speedwagon - Can't Fight This Feeling,zpOULjyy-n8,48483950,CMgBEAA,t,0,12,7,24,206,1,7.685597994683849,3.972480549876476,5.345675573046826,3.94571471405986,7,30,0.14305555555555555,213,0.40909090909090906,29,0.0,6,0,2,0,0,1,4,0,3,2,3,0,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,41,0.6955445206403518,0.5168733197630494,1.3548053927970138,0,0,7.0

On February 6th, a sold-out crowd of 1300 singers at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto raised their voices to protest the current US administration’s threatening action on global liberty, women’s rights, healthcare etc. Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman, co-founders of C!C!C!, taught their arrangement of “Quiet” to the pumped-up, all-ages crowd, and an hour later, MILCK joined them to sing lead and record a powerful show of peaceful, harmonic resistance, with proceeds going to support the American Civil Liberties Union.

“Quiet” has quickly grown from female empowerment anthem to a unifying message of hope and raucous protest for young and old, and for all genders. Play it, feel it, share it!

LYRICS:
Alright kick back relax and let’s hit it again
while you go tell your mother father cousin or kin
and your other friends, that don’t even have a clue
what this two dude crew is about to do
you know it ain’t fools gold this is kryptonite
super mc’s freeze when i hit the mic right
E F F is my AKA 
I keep it popping like bubble double u RAP
And if you don’t know by now, then listen up stupid
CSWS came to do it
got more flavor than you and your crew kid
So get your hands up if you’re ready to lose it and
bounce to the bounce to the breakneck beat
and like junior senior said to move your feet yo
You bring the ruckus, I’ll bring the refreshments 
And stay fresh to death like I’m choking on a breath mint

Chorus:
I feel I can fly
I'm on 678 cloud 9
And ain't nothin gonna stop me
Cuz I'm just too mighty and high
can't nobody get me down

Up and away, lemme get that
touching ozone with no jetpack
I’ma bag of bones full of helium
lead foot on the verse, equilibrium
Raps a million, none quotidien
Extraordinaire, next heir to the throne
like a rising son making rising sums
Up and away with a million thumbs
So self-made you’d think I was asexual
Fresh biggie lemme finish my victuals (bon appetit)
Yeah time for treats, better get it fast ‘fore it melts in the heat
I’m wrecking on the mic I’m on a mission to ruin
You wanna how it’s done? Then get to doin’ as I’m doin’
I’ma sally forth like a stallion, raps komandant
In bold font wordplay savant 

chorus

Hey naysayers, how y’all been?
It’s been a minute but I’m in it to win
And I aint finished this is the starting gun
and I’ma run it to the front until i’m number one son
this is a rhythmic defibrillation
innovative old school to thrill the nation
I been patiently waiting and building steam
but i’m back with the bounce like a trampoline, Oh please
I feel it bubbling up
it’s ten times bigger but it’s never enough
Ya gotta get up early or you’ll miss the call
so let me show all of y’all whats in my crystal ball
I sized up the prize eyes on the opportunity
my mind on my money and my roots in the community
so get your beauty sleep creativity coma
My future’s so bright i’m getting melanoma

chorus

Fresh big, how you feelin?
David eff, man I'm on top
I can't believe they're hearing this

Lyrics
Oh woman

I love the way you're so deliberate
How you light your cigarette
Head on one side as you pull, you look almost regal
I'm digging it, on your mobile, one eye closed
Blue smoke curling out your nose
Wearing one of my shirts and what some call pantyhose
Cause you look wicked in scanty clothes
Long legs like an antelope
You're my antidote to city life, my pretty wife
Hooked up the year before
Together thirteen outta 24
And you would never guess
I wanna miss you less and see you more
See you more, see you more, see you more
And when I kiss you I'm never sure
How do I get to miss you less and see you more?

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better

I can gauge your mood, from your approach to food
You use ya rude red shoes to accessorize your attitude
Desensitized to my roving eyes, and ready smile
Hmm, I get loving that's versatile
Worth that extra mile lying next to me
Your textured voice whispering
I'm listening with my whole skin
Holding onto the moment for all its worth
How could I continue to be the sky without my earth
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
How do I get to miss you less and see you more?

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better

I guess what I'm tryna say is that I

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better

Ja nechcem liečik – nevymýšľaj!

že majú strach, hneď ako sa uňho dvere otvoria. 
Nebojte sa, je to chvíľa, stetoskopom zisťuje
ako dýchaš, čo ťa trápi? Prečo bruško choré je.

誕生於2016年的冬天，知名音樂製作人 Skot Suyama 陶山首次與 Julia 見面。在聽了這首歌的 demo 後立馬加上編曲，賦予了歌曲全新生命。終於可以為這首歌配上優美的MV畫面，導演Director K讓整首歌的氣氛又上一層了。
When Julia first met music producer Skot Suyama, he was thrilled at the fact she was such a great writer, he took a backseat from songwriter and went straight at bringing Julia’s Garageband idea into the song you need to cruise to this summer. Finally almost a year after the song's release we have a music video for the song directed by Director K, bringing the song's chill vibes back to life again.

Lyrics:

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
The way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
It'd fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face

LYRICS

I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,
But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.
My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from,
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,

It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face,
Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.",342800,226,0,1,9092184,2015-04-28 03:05:18,0,"twenty one pilots, blurryface, stressed out, 21 pilots, twentyonepilots, fueled by ramen, FBR, fueledbyramen, music, song, tyler joseph, josh dun, TOP",twenty one pilots: Stressed Out [OFFICIAL VIDEO],pXRviuL6vMY,1494328590,CGQQAA,v,0,15,4,28,118,1,9.174446105600447,5.6815261496527185,6.9586682160296265,5.53504081325116,9,18,0.1759419316315868,321,0.5,12,0.0,6,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,2,1,0,1,3,5,1,0,1,0,1,0,48,0.7584837423353303,0.6192772930656256,1.2572026929539943,0,0,7.0

Lyrics:
HALLELUJAH   
I've heard there was a secret chord 
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music do you?

It goes like this 
The fourth the fifth 
The minor fall the major lift 
The baffled king composing Hallelujah!

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you 
To a kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!

Hallelujah Hallelujah

0,Rick Beato,646,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"This episode of Everything Music is called John Williams vs. Gustav Holst or Star Wars vs. the Planets. John Williams was influenced by a number of composers such as Wagner, Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Erich Korngold and especially Gustav Holst. In today’s episode I will show you the melodic and harmonic influences that Holst had on John Williams music of Star Wars.

Gustav Holst (1874-1934) was an English composer, arranger and teacher and best known for his orchestral suite The Planets. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences like Wagner, Richard Strauss, Ravel, Grieg and Ralph Vaughn Williams.The Planets, Op. 32, is a seven-movement orchestral suite written between 1914 and 1916. Each movement of the suite is named after a planet of the Solar System and its corresponding astrological character as defined by Holst. 

John Williams (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist. With a career spanning over six decades he has composed some of the most popular and recognizable film scores in cinematic history, to many of the highest-grossing films of all-time, including Jaws, the Star Wars series, Superman, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones series, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and the first three Harry Potter films.

From their premieres to the present day, both The Planets and Star Wars have been enduringly popular, influential and widely performed and recorded.

There’s a stranger in my bed
There’s a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a mini-bar
DJs passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise

I’m screwed
Oh well
It’s a blacktop blur
But I’m pretty sure
It ruled

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Then got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke a law
Always say we’re gonna stop
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don’t know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Σ' ένα δωμάτιο σκοτεινό
έψαχνα να ονειρευτώ κάτι δικό μου
Είχα τα μάτια μου κλειστά
πάλευα μέσα στη φωτιά τον εαυτό μου.
Μα έγιν' η σκέψη φυλακή
γίναν χιλιάδες τα γιατί μες το μυαλό μου.
Κι είπα να φύγω να σωθώ
να κάνω κάτι πια και γω για το καλό μου.
Είπα να φύγω
ν' αλλάξω δρόμο στην καρδιά
Είπα να φύγω
να μην πονάω άλλο πια.
Μα που να πάω
που σ' αγαπώ τόσο πολύ.
Μα που να πάω
αφού είσαι όλη μου η ζωή.
Σε μια παραίσθηση τρελή
έψανα λόγο κι αφορμή στον πανικό μου
Να βρω τον τρόπο να σου πω
πως έπαψα να αγαπώ τον εαυτό μου.
Μα εσύ δεν ήσουν εκεί
μιλούσα μόνος στη σιωπή με τον καημό μου
Κι είπα να φύγω να σωθώ
να κάνω κάτι πια και γω για το καλό μου

First version: Themis Adamantidis

In a dark room
I tried to dream of something mine
I had my eyes closed
fighting in the the fire with myself

But my thought turned out to be my prison
Thousands whys in my mind

And I said to save myself
and do something for my own good

I said I 'll leave
to change my heart 's way

I said I 'll leave
to suffer no more pain

Where shall I go
oh, I love you so

Where shall I go
you are my life and all

Like a crazy illusion
I searched for my panic 's reason
to find a way to tell you
I stopped loving myself

But you weren 't there
I was talking alone to my pain
and I said to save myself
and do something for my own good

Mузика: Iosif Sarasidis
Първото изпълнение: Themis Adamantidis

В една тъмна стая
исках да си помечтая за нещо мое
Очите ми бяха затворени ..
и се борех в огъня със себе си

Но мисълта стана ""затвор""
появиха се хиляди""Защо?"" в главата ми

Казах си ""Да си тръгна, да се спася,
да направя вече нещо и аз за мое добро!""

Казах си ""Да си тръгна,
да променя пътя на сърцето""

Казах си ""Да си тръгна,
да не страдам повече""

Но къде да отида,
когато толкова много те обичем?

Но къде да отида,
след като ти си целият ми живот?

В една луда заблуда
търсех причина и мотив в паниката си
Да намеря начин да ти кажа,
че престанах да обичам себе си

Но ти не беше там
говорех сам в мълчанието с мъката си
И си казах ""Да си тръгна, да се спася,
Да направя вече нещо и аз за мое добро""

En una habitación oscura
Trataba de soñar algo mío
Tenía los ojos cerrados
Peleaba yo mismo en el fuego

Pero los pensamientos se volvieron una cárcel
Se transformaron en miles los porques dentro de mi cabeza

Dije que me iba

Dije que me iba

Pero adonde voy

Pero adonde voy
Si toda mi vida sos vos

En una alucinación loca
Buscaba las explicaciones y los motivos para mi miedo

Since 2011 they have been maintaining a check-point controlling access through their territory to stop government and industry plans to build several gas and oil pipelines through their territory. These pipelines form part of an energy corridor that will serve to unlock the vast energy reserves of the tar sands and transport fracked gas with disastrous implications for the climate. The camp was established to oppose these projects, to defend the sacred headwaters, the salmon that spawn there and to maintain their autonomy over their unceded lands. 

This video, filmed at the camp in 2013, reveals how the Unist’ot'en camp is succeeding in stopping up to 7 pipelines,  holding up billions in investment and keeping millions of barrels (and cubic metres) of fossil fuels under the ground. It also show how the camp, beyond being a simple movement of resistance is creating a new intentional community,  informed by a millennia old relationship with the territory and natural law, but through a constant process of re-iminagination.

As of Fall 2015, the camp continues on high alert amidst multiple incursions from the companies trying to build the pipelines. Yet while under attack, the camp enjoys wide support and solidarity. As this video highlights, the Unist’ot’en form part of a networked ""corridor or resistance” of numerous justice movements who are increasingly willing to take action to oppose extreme energy projects and who are building energy sovereignty from the ground up. 

Welcome to the gateway of meaningful decolonization

배우 이승기와 차승원, 그리고 홍자매의 조합으로 방송 전부터 뜨거운 화제를 불러 모은 tvN 화제작 ‘화유기’의 첫 번째 OST 주자로 뉴이스트 W가 발탁됐다. 

오는 23일 첫 방송을 앞두고 있는 tvN 새 토일드라마 ‘화유기’(극본 홍정은 홍미란, 연출 박홍균) 측은 

뉴이스트 W가 가창자로 참여한 OST Part 1 ‘Let Me Out’을 오는 23일 오후 6시에 발매한다고 전했다.


‘Let Me Out’은 콤플렉스트로 장르를 기반으로 한 강렬한 락 사운드와 덥스텝의 요소가 조화롭게 어우러진 곡으로,

쉴 틈 없는 다이나믹한 구성이 곡의 몰입도를 높여주고 있어 리스너들의 두 귀를 사로잡을 전망이다. 


또한, 인트로를 시작으로 곡 전반적으로 흘러 나오는 신비로운 피아노 사운드가 드라마 속 주인공들의 감정선을

더욱 풍부하게 배가시켜줄 전망으로 시청자들의 기대감을 모으고 있다.


특히, ‘화유기’ OST의 첫 번째 가창자이자 Mnet ‘프로듀스101’ 시즌2를 통해 데뷔 6년만에 주목 받는 대세로 떠오른 그룹 뉴이스트 W의

시원시원한 보컬이 감성적인 멜로디 라인과 어우러져 곡의 느낌을 살려준다.


뿐만 아니라, 뉴이스트 W 의 첫 번째 OST 출사표로 더욱 기대를 모으고 있는 한편, 

리더 JR이 이번 OST의 가창은 물론 작사에도 직접 참여해 퀄리티를 높였다는 후문이라 

드라마를 기다려온 팬들은 물론 뉴이스트 W팬들에게 의미있는 OST가 될 전망이다.

Mateusz Ziółko - pianista, wokalista, autor muzyki i tekstów. Swoją przygodę z muzyką rozpoczął, jeszcze jako dziecko, od nauki gry na pianinie. Mając 15 lat założył swój pierwszy zespół. Szerszej publiczności zaprezentował się pierwszy raz w 2008 roku, biorąc udział w programie „Mam Talent” na antenie TVN, gdzie szybko zyskał przychylność jurorów oraz sympatię widzów.
W 2012 roku wraz z zespołem pojawił się także w „Must Be The Music – Tylko Muzyka”.
W między czasie występował jako gość specjalny w poszczególnych odcinkach „Jaka To Melodia”. Na scenie można go było zobaczyć i posłuchać w wielu projektach: ""Michael Jackson Symfonicznie"", ""Freddie Mercury Symfonicznie"", „Queen Story” czy podczas koncertów z Orkiestrą Akademii Bethowenowskiej oraz Orkiestrą Symfoników Bydgoskich.
Wystąpił także na jednej scenie z Amy McDonald, Coolio oraz Johnem Milesem w duecie podczas polskiej edycji światowej trasy Night Of The Proms, dodatkowo 19 czerwca wziął udział w koncercie Europejskiej Stolicy Kultury u boku Andrei Bocellego.

W 2013 Mateusz Ziółko został zwycięzcą III edycji programu „The Voice Of Poland” na antenie TVP2, tym samym podpisując kontrakt z wytwórnią. Zwyciężył także w konkursie Super Debiuty 2014 podczas
51. Krajowego Festiwalu Piosenki Polskiej w Opolu wykonując utwór „Wspomnienie” autorstwa Czesława Niemena. W październiku 2015 roku wspólnie z Liberem, Mateusz nagrał utwór „7 rzeczy” , który szybko został uznany za jeden z lepszych utworów według największych stacji radiowych w Polsce. Obecnie pracuje nad debiutanckim albumem, którego premiera jest zaplanowana na wiosnę 2017 r. oraz intensywnie koncertuje w całej Polsce.

Projekt B.O.K po pięciu latach swej działalności cały czas ewoluuje, poszerza swój skład, ciągle poszukując własnego unikatowego stylu oraz brzmienia. Do głównego trzonu grupy, który od początku istnienia składu stanowią Bisz, Oer, Dj Paulo oraz Kay, dołączyli znakomici instrumentaliści, Marcin Bartyna -- Gitara, Michał ""Bromba"" Lutrzykowski -- Bass, Arek „Pestka"" Wiśniewki -- Perkusja, Łukasz Sylwestrzak -- Skrzypce. Już dziś B.O.K w tym składzie możecie spotkać na scenach koncertowych w całym kraju. Dzięki takiemu połączeniu różnorodnych styli, nurtów muzycznych, temperamentu i najwyższych umiejętności, powstał Band, unikalny na polskiej scenie hiphopowej. Obecnie B.O.K pracuje nad kolejnym czwartym już albumem, którego wydaniem tym razem zajmie się wytwórnia Aptaun.

Hej nauczyciele odpierdolcie od nas się
W dwuszeregu zbiórka kurwa ABC
Ziemia jest okrągła a bramki są dwie
Gówno prawda żygać mi się chce

Huzia na wroga, modły wznoś do boga
Ojczyznę kochać trzeba i szanować
Strach hodować, zarabiać i szpanować
Wydawać, głupie emocje kontrolować
Imponować, importować, implodować
Luz jak Wałęsę internować 
Fotografować własny ryj gdzie się da
LALALALALALA
Trzeba zarabiać, trzeba sport uprawiać
Na lekcjach nie gadać, trzeba się spowiadać
Trzeba myślą swym właściwy ton nadawać
Nie wolno podpowiadać.
Trzeba mieć auto, dwa auta, auta trzy.
Trzeba hodować świnie koty i psy
Budować domy, przeciwatomowe schrony
Powiedz kochanie czemu jestem wkurwiony?

Trzeba napierdalać, napierdalać,  napierdalać 
W życiu trzeba się starać.
Bo nic samo nie przychodzi. Wiesz co dzi?
Powiedz lepiej co się godzi, co się nie godzi.
Nie chcesz nie szkodzi, zamiast słów wolisz test.
I niby nie, bo gdyby nie zeszli by z drzew.
Mówiła ci mama, mówił kumpel Trumana
Bezpieczna jest tylko norma akceptowana
Patrz: pasą się krowy, a nie stado kotletów
Dość już tabelek, tabletek, tabletów
Dość już widoków na zmarnowane dziś
Proszę państwa: oto miś
Miś – na miarę potrzeb i możliwości
Miś – co niby tęskni do normalności
Dziś – gdy na ulicach i w głowach pościg
Miś – co daje nura w podświadomości

ما عاد نبضي يعزف لحن الهوى 
بل يبحث عن برٍ فيه يرسيكِ
وصارت مشاعري للسائحين فقط
و انتهت وطناً لطالما كان يؤويكِ
فما يعني ؟؟ أن أُقصي روحي عنكِ
و غصباً عني تأتيكِ
و أن أعادي كلَّ ما في لكِ
وأنتِ لا أعاديكِ

فلتسلمي يا ذنباً رغماً عني أحملهُ
لست بحاقدٍ أبداً إن كان هذا يعزيكِ
لكن كفى تظهرين في كل امرأةٍ أعرفها
و تحبطين مسعايَ في تخطيكِ

أنا عم دور بعيون الكل

Jest to czwarty singiel który promuje kolejny solowy album rapera pt. ""Złota Owca"" którego premiera odbędzie się 24 listopada 2017r.

Po świetnym 2016r w wykonaniu Palucha ( dwa albumy - ""10/29"" platynowy i ""Ostatni Krzyk Osiedla"" podwójna platyna) raper nie zwalnia tempa i po równych 12 miesiącach wyda kolejny album 
pt.""ZŁOTA OWCA"" który trafi do sprzedaży 24 listopada 2017r.
Materiał będzie cięższy od swojego poprzednika, zarówno w warstwie lirycznej jak i muzycznej. Paluch porusza się między życiem prywatnym, rodzinnym często schodząc na tematy osiedlowe i mocno braggowe.  
Tytuł albumu oznacza przeciwieństwo do przysłowiowej czarnej owcy. 
Złota Owca jako przywódca stada, głowa rodziny, dobry duch.

LYRICS
If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor (Ooh)
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' ""There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy""

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

Oh, don't just say (don't just say) goodbye (goodbye),
Don't just say (don't just say) goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away

Si tú superas lo que yo sufrí por ti
Teniendo que olvidarte sin saber por qué
Y ahora me llamas, me quieres ver
Me juras que has cambiado y pensas en volver
Si no supiste amar ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar
Contigo yo perdí, ya tengo con quién ganar

Ya sé que no hubo nadie
Que te diera lo que yo te di
Que nadie te ha cuidado como te cuidé
Por eso comprendo que estás aquí
Pero ha pasado el tiempo y yo también cambié
Si no supiste amar, ahora te puedes marchar

Aléjate de mí, no hay nada más qué hablar

Dom Kane is a true master at music production.  His long list of accolades are not only in releasing music alongside top artists for some of the biggest labels, he already has a long list of accomplishments in the areas of sound design and sound for film and gaming.  When Dom is in the studio, he brings a technical knowledge and sonic authenticity to rank him among the best making music today.  

As an artist, 2016 has seen Dom Kane signed to Mau5trap, with his music having previously been heard globally in DJ sets from the likes of Dave Seaman, Deadmau5, Orbital, and James Zabiela to name a few, with international radio plays on BBC Radio 1 & Sirius (Pete Tong), Capital FM (Andi Durrant), and Apple Beats 1 (Deadmau5). Dom has also engineered for several UK Top 40 acts, recording vocals and instrumentation for artists including Sian Evans (Kosheen), Chris Jones (Armada), and many more. As a DJ, Dom has held residencies at legendary clubs including Space Ibiza and Ministry Of Sound in London.

As a sound designer, the name Dom Kane has appeared in factory presets for synthesisers including FXpansion (D-CAM & Geist), Xfer (Nerve/Serum), Ohm Force (Ohmicide), Cakewalk (Rapture Pro), and the legendary hardware synth company Moog (Animoog, Little Phatty, Slim Phatty, Sub 37 Tribute). Since Dom Kane was featured with an Artist Series sample pack on Loopmasters back in 2008, his sound banks and samples have appeared in studios worldwide via his own label Quantum Loops too.

The past few years alone saw Dom Kane ascending fast amongst the ranks of House music producers: his singles and remixes topping the online Top 40 (Signal Rejected, Space, Blagger); as well as having a full artist feature and front cover DVD in Future Music Magazine, and Computer Music Magazine. Ministry Of Sound TV have released several worldwide exclusive previews of his work across their networks, gaining over 20,000 plays in in the space of hours on the MOS YouTube channel, and his music was featured in the League Of Legends global gaming competition with millions of plays to just his tracks alone.

His music has appeared on TV channels including; Sky1 (Got To Dance), Sky Sports (Football Saturday, Super Saturday, Golf 2013, Trans World Sport), Disney Channel (Music Video, Teen Beach Movie, Phineas & Ferb, Where’s My Water), Channel 4 (Embarrassing Bodies), TV3 Norway (Norway’s Next Top Model, Paradise Hotel, Tonarsbossen), E4 (Geeks, Made In Chelsea), Channel 5 (Takes A Thief To Catch A Thief, Celebrity Big Brother, CBB Big On The Side), BT Sport (Football 2013, Football 2014), TV USA (NFL Football), STM Sweden (Aina, Top Model Sverige), Canal+ (Sportmania), ABC Australia (From Mao To Now), 4Seven (Secret Life Of Students), E!

In his course for FaderPro, Dom goes in depth into the techniques he has used to create a sound that is at the forefront of the cutting-edge.  With a deep knowledge base in synths and sound design, he demonstrates how to incorporate a unique, one of a kind, “human” touch to your productions.  No matter what genre of music you are making, what synths or DAW you use, you will take away valuable lessons to use in your own music and projects.",0,697,0,1,18,2017-10-17 17:48:06,0,"dom kane future music, faderpro, dom kane, Dom Kane, mau5trap, steve duda, in the studio, hardware synth, moog, synthesizer, music production, edm, deep house, house, ableton, Learn Bitwig, sylenth, dubspot, sound design tutorial, bitwig, bitwig studio, daw, bitwig studio 2, bitwig studio tutorial, serum, dom kane spaced, dom kane serial number, dom kane borg, faderpro dom kane, faderpro in the studio with dom kane, dom kane faderpro, dom kane artist access, artist access dom kane",Artist Access - Behind The Scenes w/ Dom Kane,v17--sYZ9yU,751,CMgBEAA,w,0,17,10,17,290,1,2.8756399370041685,0.4771212547196624,1.2552725051033058,0.0,2,42,0.19604774156660948,545,0.13333333333333333,32,-0.4,8,0,1,0,3,1,6,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,45,0.4365193600736553,0.16591828781482484,10.0,0,0,7.0

LYRICS - 
I'm the girl you've been thinking about
The one thing you can't live without
I'm the girl you've been waiting for
I'll have you down on your knees, I'll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldn't get this far, you thought I'd end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that I'd never escape, I'd be a rat in a cage, I'd be a slave to this place
You don't know how hard I fought to survive, waking up alone when I was left to die
You don't know about this life I've led, all these roads I've walked, all these tears I've bled

So how can this be, you're praying to me
There's a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

[CHORUS]
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something, baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

I'm the one that you need and fear, now that you're hooked it's all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones from the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place, take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face

So how can this be, you're praying to me
There's a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

[CHORUS]
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something, baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something, baby
(Scream) You love me, you want me, you need me

I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore

Lyrics
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?",71431,302,0,1,2085007,2009-10-25 21:05:50,1,"Faith, acoustic, amazing, George Michael Careless Whisper, music, vocal, George Michael Official, fast love, jesus to a child, George Michael Careless Whisper Lyrics, Freedom, instrumental, George Michael Careless Whisper Official, outside, vevo, official, download, karaoke, remix, I can't make you love me, lyrics, audio, Careless Whisper, official video, cover, George Michael, Sony, music video, one more try, single, Father Figure, album, Pop",George Michael - Careless Whisper (Official Video),izGwDsrQ1eQ,401056770,CPoBEAA,w,0,9,10,25,298,6,8.603205851803953,5.1676303866211395,6.3191075173703375,4.85388673008313,8,43,0.025148809523809528,292,0.020779220779220783,32,-0.5,6,0,3,0,2,1,7,2,1,2,5,0,0,3,0,0,2,1,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.7345061394811706,0.6006633429022941,1.3018654675656416,1,0,7.0

Lyrics:

(Cash Rules Everything Around Me
C.R.E.A.M. get...)
Yeah, check this ol fly s**t out
Word up
(Cash Rules Everything Around Me) Take you on a natural joint
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money) Here we here we go
(dolla dolla bill y'all) Check this s**t, yo!

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had second hands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to G' off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin with this one
And that one, pullin out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin woolies at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough off
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catchin keys from across seas
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo brothas respect mine, or anger the tech nine
Ch-POW!

Are You Happy?

--Lyrics--
Now the show is done
I hope that you had gut-trembling or something resembling fun
And if you watch this thing alone
You probably didn’t laugh, but maybe a few times you exhaled out of your nose
But if you hated it, that’s fair
But either way, could you find a little more time for a parting questionnaire?

On a scale from one to zero, are you happy?
‘Cause you’re on your own from here, so are you happy?
I’m open to suggestions, are you happy?
But what the fuck kind of question is ""Am I happy?""

I really wanna try to get happy
And I think that I could get it if I didn’t always
Panic every time I’m unhappy like
I’m owed some life
Where I’m always, like, happy
Which is stupid ‘cause I wouldn’t even want it if I got it
Wait, oh god, my dad was right

So if you know or ever knew how to be happy
On a scale from one to two now, are you happy?
You’re everything you hated, are you happy?

0,DEL Records,10535,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"El reconocido y talentoso cantautor sinaloense, Lenin Ramírez estrena el video de “Recordando A Manuel” al lado de Gerardo Ortiz y Jesus Chairez. Este nuevo tema estará incluido en su próxima producción discográfica la cual saldrá al mercado en los próximos meses. El último álbum de Lenin, SIEMPRE FIRME, es su segunda producción bajo el sello DEL Records. Este álbum incluye corridos, baladas y temas bailables como el éxito “La Viuda Negra.” Una de las influencias musicales más destacadas en las producciones del cantautor es la música sierreña.

Lenin Ramírez ha realizado extensas giras en todo México y sus composiciones han sido interpretadas por varios de los artistas más sobresalientes del género incluyendo Los Alegres del Barranco y Jesús Ojeda, entre otros.Tal vez el mayor desafío para Lenin fue tomar las tradiciones y grabar música que suene fresca. Ramírez combina varios géneros como parte de su repertorio para que su música tenga un toque moderno y único para sus fans.

La vida nos cruzó 
de un modo muy casual
Llegaste como el Sol 
robándome la sombra 
De forma gradual.

Cualquier fuga de luz
todo era una señal
10 pasos hacia ti
1000 dudas sobre mi
Y el miedo natural.

Me hacías temblar así
como la luna sobre el agua,
entonces me solté para abrazarme a tu mirada
Y así te descubrí,
pero en un beso fue que yo te conocí

Marlon y Gaby:
LETRA

Coro 
Marlon y Gaby son una pareja bella, 
Él ama a Gaby y dice que es su doncella, 
Gaby lo quiere pero no como el a ella, 
Ya por ahí suenan rayos y centellas 

Marlon tiene un gran amigo de la infancia, 
Se llama Luis y ellos se ven con constancia, 
Gaby lo trata así como con atorrancia 
Pero en el fondo Gaby por el siente ansias, 
Marlon un día oscuro se va a trabajar 
Y le dice a Gaby, Gaby no me vayas a esperar 
Porque el no sabia que Gaby iba a planear 
Algo que toda su mente iba a cambiar, My Friend 
Pasan dos horas y vuelve por un abrigo, 
Pero en el porche ve el carro de su amigo 
El piensa bueno quizás quiera hablar conmigo, 
Pero sus nervios decían veamos con que me consigo 
Y abre la puerta silenciosamente 
Y nota que todas las luces están apagadas 
Rápido los nervios llenan su mente 
Y sube a la habitación a ver que pasaba 
Marlon no podía creer lo que veía 
Su gran amigo Luis con el amor de su vida 
Les dijo que esto nunca se los perdonaría 
Y su mente se puso cruda y fría, Friend 

Coro 
Gaby son una pareja bella, 
Él ama a Gaby y dice que es su doncella, 
Gaby lo quiere pero no como el a ella, 
Ya por ahí suenan rayos y centellas 

Marlon sale corriendo hacia un callejón 
Y se dice en su mente no seré mas un cabrón 
Sale del barrio con un Glock de treinta y dos 
Y ya tenía a su amiga puesta en selector 
Llega a su casa vuelto todo un demente 
Ya la ira le ha dominado la mente 
Saca el cañón lo pone a Luis en la frente y 
Plo plo plo plo, se ha vuelto un delincuente 

Coro 
Gaby son una pareja bella, 
Él ama a Gaby y dice que es su doncella, 
Gaby lo quiere pero no como el a ella,

Realmente disfruto componer música celta relajante. Cuando hablo de música celta relajante, muchas veces me refiero a la música con arpa lenta y la música con flauta. Esta música está inspirada en nuestros bosques verdes y en el amor hacia nuestra naturaleza. A veces, también utilizo voces hermosas en mi música para expresar una sensación de fantasía y misterio. También me gusta incluir música de piano relajante con un tono suave y de reverberación.

La mayor parte de la música en este canal puede ser utilizada como música para conciliar un sueño profundo. Si sufre de insomnio o si tiene problemas para relajarse después de un largo día, espero que esta música le pueda ayudar. Para garantizar que pueda dormirse de manera rápida, la música cuenta con instrumentos suaves que son tocados en un patrón lento y repetitivo. Debido a esto, la música también puede ser utilizada como música de meditación y como música para estudiar. El solo hecho de que la música relajante no tenga tantas variaciones, hace posible que sus pensamientos vaguen sin distraerse demasiado por la música.

Muchas de las grabaciones cuentan con efectos de sonido relajantes grabados en la naturaleza. Cierre los ojos y camine en un bosque tranquilo, descanse en la playa o simplemente escuche el suave viento.  Río Azul se esfuerza continuamente para hacer la mejor música relajante posible y para satisfacer sus necesidades. Para ofrecer una buena experiencia, todas las grabaciones están llenas de hermosas fotos o vídeos de la naturaleza. Todo esto está destinado para llevarlo a un estado de profunda relajación.

La música que aparece en este canal ha sido utilizada por millones de espectadores en el canal de Soothing Relaxation. El canal en el que se encuentra actualmente es el canal oficial en español para la música de relajación compuesta por Peder B. Helland. Esto es para garantizar que pueda acceder a mi trabajo en su propio idioma nativo. Muchas gracias por todos los comentarios que deja en la sección de comentarios. Realmente aprecio todo su apoyo y espero que podamos crear una comunidad increíble juntos. Todo uso no autorizado de esta música relajante está estrictamente prohibido.

La mayor parte de la música en este canal puede ser utilizada como música para conciliar un sueño profundo. Si sufre de insomnio o si tiene problemas para relajarse después de un largo día, espero que esta música le pueda ayudar. Para garantizar que pueda dormirse de manera rápida, la música cuenta con instrumentos suaves que son tocados en un patrón lento y repetitivo. Debido a esto, la música también puede ser utilizada como música de meditación y como música para estudiar. El solo hecho de que la música relajante no tenga tantas variaciones, hace posible que sus pensamientos vaguen sin distraerse demasiado por la música.

Muchas de las grabaciones cuentan con efectos de sonido relajantes grabados en la naturaleza. Cierre los ojos y camine en un bosque tranquilo, descanse en la playa o simplemente escuche el suave viento.  Río Azul se esfuerza continuamente para hacer la mejor música relajante posible y para satisfacer sus necesidades. Para ofrecer una buena experiencia, todas las grabaciones están llenas de hermosas fotos o vídeos de la naturaleza. Todo esto está destinado para llevarlo a un estado de profunda relajación.

La música que aparece en este canal ha sido utilizada por millones de espectadores en el canal de Soothing Relaxation. El canal en el que se encuentra actualmente es el canal oficial en español para la música de relajación compuesta por Peder B. Helland. Esto es para garantizar que pueda acceder a mi trabajo en su propio idioma nativo. Muchas gracias por todos los comentarios que deja en la sección de comentarios. Realmente aprecio todo su apoyo y espero que podamos crear una comunidad increíble juntos. Todo uso no autorizado de esta música relajante está estrictamente prohibido.

0,Hip-Hop Universe,1477,xxNoneFoundxx,1,"JAY-Z' New York Times Interview With Dean Baquet, Jay-Z Opens Up About Constantly CHEATING On Beyonce.

My conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J.

When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J. Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We were triumphant when he won it the next year.

But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote.

So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black, I’m O.J.”

I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me.

What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both?

O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of that denial caused him to explode decades later.

All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply introspective therapy session put to music.
